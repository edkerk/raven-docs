**Reconstruction, Analysis and Visualization of Metabolic Networks**

A toolkit for building, curating, and simulating genome-scale metabolic
models, available as a **MATLAB** toolbox and a **Python** package built on cobrapy.

## Install

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Python (pip)

```bash
pip install --pre raven-toolbox
```
:::
:::{tab-item} MATLAB (Add-Ons)

Home → Add-Ons → Get Add-Ons → search "RAVEN Toolbox".

Then run `checkRaven` to verify.
:::
:::{tab-item} Python (git)

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox.git
pip install -e raven-toolbox/
```
:::
:::{tab-item} MATLAB (git)

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN.git
```

Add the folder to the MATLAB path, then run `checkRaven` to verify.

## Key features

::::{grid} 1 2 3 3

:::{grid-item-card} Homology reconstruction
Build draft models by transferring reactions from template models using
BLAST+, DIAMOND, or HMMER.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} KEGG-based reconstruction
Reconstruct metabolic networks directly from KEGG organism annotations and
pathway databases.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Flux analysis
FBA, FVA, gene knockouts, and flux sampling with Gurobi or GLPK solvers.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} ftINIT
Fast task-and-data-driven INIT for extracting context-specific models from
transcriptomics data.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Gap-filling
Identify and fill stoichiometric gaps by LP to restore connectivity or
enable predicted growth.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Model curation
Check mass and charge balance, dead-end metabolites, and metabolic task
fulfilment.
:::

## Quick start

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from raven_toolbox.io import read_yaml_model

# load yeast-GEM from RAVEN YAML -- returns a plain cobra.Model
model = read_yaml_model("yeast-GEM.yml")

# set growth as the objective
model.objective = "r_2111"

# constrain glucose uptake to 1 mmol/gDW/h
model.reactions.get_by_id("r_1714").lower_bound = -1.0

# run FBA -- simulation comes from cobrapy, unchanged
sol = model.optimize()
print(f"Growth rate: {sol.objective_value:.4f} h⁻¹")
```
:::
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
% load yeast-GEM from RAVEN YAML
model = readYAMLmodel('yeast-GEM.yml');

% set growth as the objective
model = setParam(model, 'obj', 'r_2111', 1);

% constrain glucose uptake to 1 mmol/gDW/h
model = setParam(model, 'lb', 'r_1714', -1);

% run FBA
sol = solveLP(model);
fprintf('Growth rate: %.4f h-1\n', sol.f);
```
