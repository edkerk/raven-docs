# RAVEN predictLocalization vs the deterministic MILP (head-to-head)

raven-toolbox's compartment-assignment MILP is a deterministic successor to RAVEN's
[`predictLocalization`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/blob/main/localization/predictLocalization.m)
(Agren et al., [pcbi.1002980](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002980); RAVEN 2.0, Wang et al.,
[pcbi.1006541](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006541)). Both optimise the *same* objective —
sum of per-gene localisation scores minus inter-compartment transport cost — but `predictLocalization`
solves it by **stochastic simulated annealing** (greedy hill-climbing in the shipped code, no random
seed, wall-clock budget) while raven-toolbox's `assign_compartments` solves it to a **deterministic
global optimum** by MILP. This is the controlled head-to-head: same model, same scores, same default
compartment.

* Driver: [`scripts/compare_predictlocalization.py`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox/blob/develop/scripts/compare_predictlocalization.py)
  (`--prep`/`--score`) + [`scripts/run_predictlocalization.m`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox/blob/develop/scripts/run_predictlocalization.m) (the actual RAVEN function, MATLAB R2024b).
* Model: yeast-GEM; scores: the slow DeepLoc 2.1 run, normalised, mapped to yeast compartment ids
  (identical to the MILP's input). 1143 genes.
* Metric: **gene-level** agreement with curated yeast-GEM (a gene is correct if its assigned
  compartment is in the collapsed compartment set of its reactions) — the native output of
  `predictLocalization` and the common denominator across methods.

## Two setup findings (needed to run predictLocalization fairly)

1. **`transportCost` must be dialled down for soft scores.** Its default (0.5) is sized for clean
   integer-style scores and overwhelms DeepLoc's 0-1 probabilities: at 0.5, **86-97% of genes are
   stranded in the default compartment** (moving a gene out costs ~0.5 per transported metabolite but
   gains <=1.0 in score). At `transportCost=0.05` the assignment distributes properly. This is the
   same soft-score calibration lesson as raven-toolbox's yeast-GEM localisation benchmark (see
   [`yeast_localization_benchmark.md`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox/blob/develop/docs/studies/yeast_localization_benchmark.md));
   the MILP arm uses the matched 0.05.
2. **A crash-on-timeout bug.** When the wall-clock loop ends mid-iteration, `predictLocalization`
   raises an undefined-variable error in its epilogue (`geneScore` at line ~590), losing the whole
   run. The harness guards each run with try/catch so one bad draw does not kill a batch.

## Gene-level agreement

`transportCost`/`transport_cost` = 0.05 for both arms; `predictLocalization` run 5x at `maxTime=5 min`.

| method | n | accuracy | notes |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| argmax (DeepLoc top, no network) | 1143 | 74.5% | naive floor |
| **MILP (deterministic)** | 867 | **84.0%** | one global optimum, 90 s |
| predictLocalization (SA, mean of 5) | 911 | 75.2% | min 74.6%, max 75.9% |

### Strict common gene set (806 genes scored by every method)

Removes the differing-coverage confound — the cleanest comparison.

| method | accuracy |
|---|--:|
| argmax | 83.9% |
| **MILP (deterministic)** | **83.9%** |
| predictLocalization (mean of 5) | 76.8% (min 76.3%, max 77.4%) |

## The determinism gap (the decisive result)

Across 5 runs at identical settings, `predictLocalization` assigned **34.8% of genes (317/911) to
different compartments** between runs, with accuracy wandering over a 1.2 pp band. The MILP returns
one reproducible global optimum — no seed, no variance, no "run several and pick".

### Is predictLocalization just under-converged? (no)

The simulated annealing starts with every gene in the cytosol and moves one gene at a time, so its
accuracy keeps climbing with the wall-clock budget — but it converges *slowly* and plateaus **below**
the MILP, which reaches its optimum in 90 s:

| predictLocalization budget | accuracy | geneScore |
|---|--:|--:|
| 0.5 min | ~68% | 755 |
| 5 min (mean of 5) | 75.2% | ~951 |
| 15 min | 78.7% | 991 (still rising) |
| **MILP (90 s, optimal)** | **84.0%** | — |

Even at 3x the budget predictLocalization reaches only 78.7% and is still improving — it does not
catch the deterministic MILP, and every run is a different model.

## What this shows

* **Against the actual prior method, the MILP wins on every axis.** On the common gene set it is
  **~7 pp more accurate** (83.9% vs 76.8%), **deterministic** (vs 35% of genes flipping between runs),
  and **faster** (90 s to optimality vs a multi-minute wall-clock budget that it still needs — at
  0.5 min it scores only ~68%). `predictLocalization` underperforms because simulated annealing is a
  heuristic that does not reach the optimum and is stochastic.
* **Network-aware does not beat naive at the gene level here — but that cuts against
  `predictLocalization`, not raven-toolbox.** The MILP matches argmax (both 83.9%), i.e. the gene-level
  metric is near-saturated by simply taking each gene's top DeepLoc call. Yet `predictLocalization`,
  despite being network-aware, scores *below* argmax (76.8%): its stochastic search actively loses
  ground. The MILP recovers the argmax-level agreement **and** does the network-aware part
  (reaction-level placement, inter-compartment transports, optional flux functionality)
  deterministically — value the gene-level metric does not capture but the reaction-level benchmark
  (`yeast_localization_benchmark.md`, above) does.
* **Determinism is the headline for a paper.** Reproducibility, not a few points of agreement, is the
  clean differentiator: the same inputs always give the same model, which matters for curation and
  for anyone building on the output.
