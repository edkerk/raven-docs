# ftINIT parameter calibration & input-robustness

Empirical study of raven-toolbox's ftINIT parameters on a genome-scale model (Human-GEM,
Hart2015 / HCT116). Two questions:

1. **Calibration**: on clean data, which parameter values give the best speed/quality
   trade-off? (`scripts/analyze_init_params.py`)
2. **Robustness**: with the task layer always on (it is part of the pipeline, not a
   variable), how does degrading the *transcriptomics input* affect the model, and which
   parameters keep it functional and stable? (`scripts/analyze_init_robustness.py`)

Both scripts are resumable and reusable on any model/dataset; the numbers below are HCT116.
"Jaccard" is reaction-set overlap with the reference (tightest setting / clean data); for
a model-extraction tool the reaction set is the product, and a MIP gap bounds only the
*objective*, so set-stability is tracked separately.

## 1. Clean-data calibration

### ftINIT MILP: `mip_gap` (single step-0 solve, big_m=100, force_on=0.1)

| mip_gap | time (s) | objective | rel.obj.gap | Jaccard vs tightest |
|--------:|---------:|----------:|------------:|--------------------:|
| 0.0002 | 48 | 49357 | ref | ref |
| 0.001 | 44 | 49357 | +0.0000 | **1.0000** |
| 0.003 | 42 | 49289 | +0.0014 | 0.9973 |
| 0.01 | 42 | 49185 | +0.0035 | 0.9935 |
| 0.03 | 52 | 49185 | +0.0035 | 0.9935 |
| 0.1 | 46 | 45615 | +0.0758 | 0.9469 |

**Solve time is essentially flat across the gap** (the model build dominates), so a tight
gap is nearly free. `mip_gap=0.001` reproduces the proven optimum exactly (Jaccard 1.0);
quality only collapses at 0.1. → **Default 0.001.** (The genome-scale staged pipeline still
needs *some* gap + a `time_limit` because the full essential-forced MILP can be much harder
than this single step; see robustness timings.)

### ftINIT MILP: `big_m` (gap=0.001, force_on=0.1)

| big_m | time (s) | rel.obj.gap | Jaccard vs big_m=100 |
|------:|---------:|------------:|---------------------:|
| 100 | 51 | ref | ref |
| 50 | 54 | +0.0006 | 0.983 |
| 25 | 53 | +0.0007 | 0.982 |
| 250 | 55 | +0.0005 | 0.984 |
| 1000 | 59 | +0.0001 | 0.986 |

At step-0 (on the *scaled* model) `big_m` barely affects objective or time, but shifts which
reactions are kept by ~2% (alternate optima). `big_m=100` is RAVEN's value and is required
for the *staged* pipeline to stay feasible (a fixed 100 is only valid with stoichiometric
rescaling; see §1.4). → **Default 100.**

### ftINIT MILP: `force_on` (gap=0.001, big_m=100)

| force_on | time (s) | rel.obj.gap | Jaccard vs 0.1 |
|---------:|---------:|------------:|---------------:|
| 0.1 | 63 | ref | ref |
| 0.02 | 69 | +0.0005 | 0.983 |
| 0.05 | 56 | +0.0000 | 0.990 |
| 0.2 | 59 | +0.0004 | 0.982 |
| 0.5 | 79 | +0.0005 | 0.985 |

`force_on` (minimum flux for a reaction to count as "on") changes the *model*, not just a
tolerance, but the reaction set is fairly insensitive (Jaccard ≥0.98) and the objective
hardly moves. → **Default 0.1** (RAVEN), no strong reason to change.

### prep scaling: `rescaleModelForINIT` `max_stoich_diff` and on/off (gap=0.001, big_m=100)

| config | time (s) | rel.obj.gap | Jaccard vs scaled msd=25 |
|--------|---------:|------------:|-------------------------:|
| scale on, msd=25 | 51 | ref | ref |
| msd=10 | 49 | +0.0075 | 0.989 |
| msd=50 | 61 | +0.0003 | 0.982 |
| msd=100 | 62 | −0.0001 | 0.986 |
| scale off | 45 | +0.0129 | 0.973 |

At step-0 even `scale=off` is feasible, but it drifts most (Jaccard 0.973, objective +1.3%);
`max_stoich_diff` 10–100 are all within ~1%. **This understates scaling's importance**: at
step-0 there is no big-M cap on the held-out transports. In the *full staged pipeline*,
`scale=off` with `big_m=100` is **infeasible** (step-1 caps transports that step-0 used
freely). → **Keep scaling on, msd=25** (RAVEN's default).

**Calibration summary (defaults are well-chosen):** `mip_gap=0.001`, `big_m=100`,
`force_on=0.1`, scaling on (`max_stoich_diff=25`). For the genome-scale staged pipeline also
set a `time_limit` (≈120–600 s/step) so a hard essential-forced step returns a near-optimal
incumbent rather than grinding.

### ftINIT full pipeline (`ftinit`, series='1+1', no-task scaled prep, `time_limit=600s`)

| config | time (s) | n_kept | Jaccard vs gap=0.001 |
|--------|---------:|-------:|---------------------:|
| **mip_gap=0.001** (default big_m=100) | 346 | 7752 | ref |
| mip_gap=0.003 | 288 | 7748 | 0.993 |
| mip_gap=0.01 | 218 | 7746 | **0.995** |
| big_m=50 (gap=0.003) | 738 | 7799 | 0.974 |
| big_m=250 (gap=0.003) | 345 | 7766 | 0.977 |

Unlike the single-step ftINIT MILP in §1.1 (where build time dominated and the gap was
free), **the full pipeline does benefit from a looser gap**: `mip_gap=0.01` is ~37 %
faster than `0.001` with Jaccard 0.995, essentially the same model. → **For genome-scale
ftINIT, `mip_gap=0.01` (or 0.005) is the best measured trade-off**; keep 0.001 only if exact
reproducibility matters more than a few minutes.

`big_m=50` is actually *slower* than the default 100 (738s vs 346s); a tighter cap makes
the LP relaxation harder for borderline reactions; `big_m=250` is the same speed as 100
but shifts the reaction set ~2 %. → **Keep `big_m=100`** (RAVEN's value, what scaling is
designed for).

## 2. Robustness to degraded transcriptomics (task layer always on)

The metabolic-task + gap-fill layer is held fixed; only the expression input is degraded.
`frac` = fraction of the 69 essential tasks the extracted model performs (`check_tasks`);
`Jaccard` = reaction-set overlap with the clean-data model.

| input | n_rxns | tasks pass | frac | Jaccard vs clean |
|-------|-------:|-----------:|-----:|-----------------:|
| **clean** | 7777 | 69/69 | 1.000 | ref |
| dropout 50% | 5968 | 67/69 | 0.971 | **0.713** |
| dropout 70% | 5113 | 68/69 | 0.986 | **0.594** |
| noise σ=1.0 | 7812 | 69/69 | 1.000 | 0.952 |
| noise σ=2.0 | 7768 | 69/69 | 1.000 | 0.919 |
| downsample 50% | 6765 | 68/69 | 0.986 | 0.815 |
| downsample 70% | 6123 | 68/69 | 0.986 | 0.728 |

(dropout = genes set to 0 → score −5; noise = ×`exp(N(0,σ))`; downsample = genes dropped →
`no_gene_score`.)

**Findings:**

* **The model is robust to noise but sensitive to sparsity.** Multiplicative expression noise barely changes
  the model (Jaccard 0.92–0.95, size stable, all tasks pass). Sparsity is far more damaging:
  50% dropout already drops the reaction set to **0.71 Jaccard** (and shrinks 7777→5968), 70%
  to **0.59**.
* **Sparsity shrinks the model toward the task-essential core.** Missing/zeroed genes remove
  the expression evidence for a reaction; the task layer only adds back what tasks require, so
  sparse input yields smaller, more "generic" models. Dropout (−5) is harsher than
  downsampling (−2).
* **Functionality is largely but not perfectly preserved.** With the task layer, `frac` stays
  ≥0.97, but dips to 67–68/69 under heavy sparsity, i.e. the bounded gap-fill plus the
  post-hoc low-score-gene pruning occasionally leave 1–2 essential tasks unsatisfied. (See the
  lever sweep below for whether `no_gene_score`/`force_on` recover them.)
* **Cost tracks damage.** Dropout runs are slowest (more broken tasks → more gap-fill);
  noise is cheap.

> **Tractability note (a parameter that prevents failure):** the gap-fill MILP must be bounded
> (`mip_gap`/`time_limit`). Unbounded, severe degradation (which breaks many tasks at once)
> makes it solve a hard min-cost MILP per broken task to proven optimality, observed to run
> >75 min for one 90%-dropout model. With the bound it returns a near-optimal fill quickly.

### Levers at dropout 70%: which parameter best stabilises the model?

| config | n_rxns | frac | Jaccard vs clean |
|--------|-------:|-----:|-----------------:|
| default (no_gene_score=−2, force_on=0.1) | 5113 | 0.986 | 0.594 |
| no_gene_score=−1.0 | 5110 | 0.986 | 0.593 |
| no_gene_score=−0.5 | 5128 | 0.986 | 0.593 |
| force_on=0.2 | 5159 | 0.986 | 0.600 |

**No lever recovers the drift**: Jaccard stays ~0.59 across all settings. Two reasons,
both informative:

* The information dropout destroys is gone; no scoring or connectivity knob reconstructs
  the missing expression evidence. No parameter setting compensates for sparse input.
* `no_gene_score` is the wrong knob *for dropout specifically*: dropout leaves genes
  *present but zero* (scored −5), whereas `no_gene_score` only governs reactions whose genes
  are **absent** from the data, i.e. the *downsampling* failure mode. So `no_gene_score` is
  a meaningful lever for missing-data sparsity (a less-negative value keeps more
  unmeasured reactions, growing the model back toward clean), but it has nothing to act on
  under dropout.

**Practical takeaway.** The robustness levers that matter are *structural*, not numeric: the
task + gap-fill layer (keeps the model functional regardless of input quality) and a bounded
gap-fill MILP (keeps it tractable). For *missing*-gene sparsity specifically, `no_gene_score`
trades model size against confidence. For noise, defaults are already robust. No parameter
restores fidelity lost to dropout; that is a property of the data, not the pipeline.

## 3. The gene-scoring constants have no confirmed source

Expression values become gene scores through

```
score = clip(factor × ln(level / reference), min_score, max_score)
```

with `factor=5.0`, `max_score=10.0`, `min_score=-5.0` on both sides. The
logarithm is natural, not base 2, in `init/score.py` and in RAVEN's `scoreModel`
alike.

The constants themselves are unattributed. Neither implementation's source cites
a paper for them, and the one candidate reference that has been suggested (a
2012 paper describing mCADRE) uses categorical scoring rather than this
continuous log-ratio, so it is not the origin. They are RAVEN's own numbers with
no literature anchor behind them. Since both implementations agree there is
nothing to reconcile, but the values rest on convention rather than evidence.

## 4. Cross-solver portability

See [init-solver-benchmark.md](init-solver-benchmark.md) for the genome-scale
solver comparison (Gurobi/HiGHS/GLPK) and [tests/test_init_solvers.py](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox/blob/develop/tests/test_init_solvers.py)
for CI parameterised over installed MILP backends. Summary: at genome scale only Gurobi
is viable today; HiGHS fails on an upstream optlang `hybrid_interface.clone()` bug; GLPK
ignores `configuration.timeout` on MIP and ran 1 h+ without converging. Toy-scale
correctness is portable (Gurobi + GLPK give identical verdicts on the unit-test
networks), so local development works without a Gurobi licence.

## Reproducing

```bash
python scripts/analyze_init_params.py    --cell HCT116 --sweeps ftinit_milp,prep_scale,ftinit_full
python scripts/analyze_init_robustness.py --cell HCT116 --algo ftinit
```

Both reuse the cached Human-GEM preps from the validation run
([docs/humangem-validation.md](humangem-validation.md)) and are resumable.
