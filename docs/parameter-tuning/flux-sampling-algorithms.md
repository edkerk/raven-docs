# Markov-chain flux sampling — CHRR and ACHR

This document describes the two Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) flux samplers added to
both raven-toolbox and MATLAB RAVEN. They are reached through the unified sampling entry
point in each — `raven_toolbox.analysis.random_sampling(method="achr"|"chrr")` and RAVEN's
`randomSampling(..., 'method', 'achr'|'chrr')` — alongside the historical random-objective
method. The samplers are **CHRR** (Coordinate Hit-and-Run with Rounding) and **ACHR**
(Artificially Centered Hit-and-Run). This explains what each samples, why rounding matters,
and which to use for enzyme-constrained and tissue-specific models. For how the defaults
around these samplers (`thinning`, `warmup`, …) were chosen, see the
[sampling convergence study](studies/sampling-convergence-calibration.md) and
[benchmark notes](benchmarks/sampling.md) in [Methods & benchmarks](index.md).

## 1. What flux sampling computes

For a model with stoichiometric matrix `S` and bounds `lb <= v <= ub`, the steady-state
feasible set is the **flux polytope**

```
P = { v : S v = 0,  lb <= v <= ub }.
```

Uniform sampling of `P` answers questions that a single FBA optimum cannot: the marginal
distribution and correlation structure of fluxes consistent with the constraints, the
spread of feasible states, and how measured data narrows the feasible space. Because `S v = 0`
removes degrees of freedom, `P` is a *lower-dimensional* polytope embedded in flux space;
both samplers handle this by working in a full-dimensional parametrisation.

These MCMC samplers draw the (near-)uniform distribution of the polytope **interior**, which
is the statistically correct object for the questions above. This is distinct from the
random-objective method (`randomSampling`), which draws polytope **vertices** — see §7.

## 2. Why rounding matters: the elongated-polytope problem {#2-why-rounding-matters}

Hit-and-run mixing time scales with the polytope's **aspect ratio** — the ratio of its
longest to shortest axis. For a near-isotropic (ball-like) polytope, hit-and-run mixes in
`O*(d²)` steps (`d` = dimension). For a long, thin slab, an unrounded chain crawls along the
long axes and almost never moves across the thin ones, so it *appears* converged (short
within-axis autocorrelation) while having explored only a sliver of the feasible set.

This is exactly the geometry of the models this work targets:

- **Enzyme-constrained models (ecModels) with proteomics data.** Each measured enzyme
  abundance imposes a tight bound `v_j <= kcat_j · [E_j]`. Thousands of such near-binding
  constraints collapse the polytope to a thin slab concentrated near an enzyme-capacity
  ridge.
- **Models conditioned on measured fluxes.** Fixing or tightly bounding measured fluxes
  collapses the polytope onto a low-dimensional face.

Both produce a badly conditioned `P` where unrounded ACHR mixes poorly. **CHRR removes the
conditioning problem** by first applying an affine transformation that makes the polytope
near-isotropic (§5), after which the mixing time no longer depends on the original aspect
ratio.

## 3. ACHR

**Artificially Centered Hit-and-Run** (Kaufman & Smith 1998; the sampler in COBRA Toolbox
and cobrapy's `ACHRSampler`):

1. Generate **warmup points** — one flux vector per reaction maximised and one minimised
   (`2·nRxns` LPs), giving vertices that span `P`.
2. Maintain a running **center** = mean of all points generated so far.
3. From the current point, choose a random warmup point, take the direction *through the
   center*, and sample uniformly along the feasible chord in that direction.
4. Record every `thinning`-th point.

Every search direction is a difference of feasible points, so each step stays exactly on
`S v = 0`; no reprojection is needed for the homogeneous (`b = 0`) steady-state problem.
ACHR does **no rounding** — directions come from the warmup vertices, which on an elongated
polytope cluster near the long axes, so the thin directions are under-explored.

ACHR is lighter than CHRR (no ellipsoid solve) and is a good default on well-conditioned
models.

## 4. CHRR

**Coordinate Hit-and-Run with Rounding** (Haraldsdóttir et al. 2017):

1. **Reduce to full dimension.** Compute a nullspace basis `N` of the equality system and a
   particular solution `v0`, parametrising `v = v0 + N x`. Reactions whose flux range is
   ~zero (detected by FVA) are folded into the equality system first, so the reduced
   polytope `{x : A x <= b}` with `A = [N; -N]`, `b = [ub - v0; v0 - lb]` is genuinely
   full-dimensional (a non-degenerate MVE requires this).
2. **Round.** Compute the maximum-volume ellipsoid `{x : x = c + E s, ||s|| <= 1}` inscribed
   in the polytope (§5) and substitute `x = c + E y`. The rounded polytope
   `{y : (A E) y <= b - A c}` contains the unit ball and is contained in a ball of radius `d`
   (John's theorem), i.e. it is well-conditioned regardless of the original aspect ratio.
3. **Walk.** Run **coordinate** hit-and-run on the rounded polytope: pick a random coordinate
   `j`, compute the feasible chord from the maintained slack `s = b_r - A_r y` and the column
   `A_r[:,j]`, and sample uniformly. The slack updates in `O(m)` per step.
4. **Map back.** `v = v0 + N (c + E y)` for each recorded point.

The rounding (step 2) is computed **once** per model; the per-step cost afterwards equals
ACHR's. The investment buys aspect-ratio-independent mixing.

## 5. The maximum-volume ellipsoid (MVE) core {#5-the-maximum-volume-ellipsoid-core}

Rounding requires the **maximum-volume inscribed ellipsoid** of `{z : A z <= b}`:

```
maximize   log det E
subject to a_i^T x + || E a_i ||_2 <= b_i   for every constraint i,
```

over the centre `x` and SPD matrix `E`. This is a convex program solved by the **Zhang & Gao
(2003)** primal-dual interior-point method — the same routine COBRA's `chrrSampler` uses.
Each Newton iteration forms the ellipsoid matrix `E2 = (Aᵀ diag(y) A)⁻¹` from the dual
variables `y`, computes residuals for dual feasibility, primal slack, and complementarity,
and takes a fraction-to-boundary step. The returned lower-triangular factor `E` (with
`E Eᵀ = E2`) is the rounding transform.

A subtlety worth noting: the MVE of a triangle is its **Steiner inellipse** (centred at the
centroid, tangent at the side midpoints), *not* its incircle — the largest inscribed *ellipse*
generally has larger area than the largest inscribed *circle*. This is used as an exact
validation case (§9): the solver must recover the off-diagonal Steiner shape, confirming it
maximises volume rather than merely fitting the biggest ball.

## 6. CHRR vs ACHR — when it matters {#6-chrr-vs-achr}

| Model class | Polytope geometry | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| ecModel + proteomics | Thin slab, many near-binding enzyme bounds | **CHRR** | Rounding finds the slab geometry; ACHR warmup directions miss the thin axes |
| Flux-measured model | Collapsed onto a low-dimensional face | **CHRR** | MVE finds the effective dimensionality automatically |
| ftINIT tissue-specific model | Pruned, moderate conditioning | CHRR preferred; ACHR acceptable | Human GEM-derived (~1500–3000 rxns); rounding cost modest, mixing safer |
| Small / well-conditioned model | Near-isotropic | ACHR (lighter) or CHRR | Either mixes well; ACHR avoids the ellipsoid solve |

For the workflows that motivated this addition — ecModels constrained with proteomics and
experimentally measured fluxes, and ftINIT-generated tissue-specific models — **CHRR is the
default**. The ecModel case is precisely the elongated-polytope regime where unrounded ACHR
gives chains that look converged but are not.

## 7. Relationship to `randomSampling` / `random_sampling` {#7-relationship-to-random-sampling}

The **random-objective** method (Bordel et al. 2010) — `method="random_objective"` — is also
dispatched from the same `random_sampling` / `randomSampling` entry: each sample maximises a
small random linear objective, returning a polytope **vertex**. That is a different statistical
object — a robust, fast spread of diverse *optimal* states, well-behaved on large or tightly
constrained models where MCMC mixing is hard. It does **not** approximate the uniform interior
distribution.

So one entry point exposes all three methods: `method="achr"` (default) and `method="chrr"`
for the (near-)uniform interior distribution, and `method="random_objective"` for diverse
vertices.

## 8. Implementation map {#8-implementation-map}

| Component | MATLAB RAVEN | raven-toolbox (Python) |
|---|---|---|
| Entry point | `randomSampling.m` (`method='achr'|'chrr'`) | `analysis.random_sampling(method=...)` |
| CHRR | `sampleCHRR.m` | `analysis.flux_sampling._sample_chrr` |
| ACHR | `sampleACHR.m` + `sampleWarmupPoints.m` | wraps `cobra.sampling.ACHRSampler` |
| MVE solver | `sampleMaxVolEllipse.m` | `analysis.max_volume_ellipsoid` |
| Interior point | `sampleChebyshevCenter.m` | `_chebyshev_center` (scipy `linprog`) |

**Does cobrapy already have these?** cobrapy ships a mature **ACHR** (`ACHRSampler`), so the
Python side **wraps** it rather than reimplementing — reachable through the one
`random_sampling` entry point (`method='achr'`) and returning the same `FluxSamplingResult`.
cobrapy has **no CHRR** (no rounding sampler), so the Python CHRR (`method='chrr'`) is a
genuine addition. MATLAB RAVEN had neither, so both are implemented there from scratch.

cobrapy also ships a parallel **`OptGPSampler`**, but it is *not* wired into `random_sampling`
— only ACHR and CHRR are. Using it means calling `cobra.sampling.OptGPSampler` directly,
bypassing this wrapper entirely — it won't return a `FluxSamplingResult` or go through
raven-toolbox's constraint handling. `method='chrr'` is the better-mixing alternative actually
available through `random_sampling`.

The MATLAB filenames are prefixed `sample*` to avoid clashing with COBRA Toolbox's
`sampleCbModel` / `ACHRSampler` / `CHRRSampler` / `mve_solver` on case-insensitive
filesystems.

The Python `max_volume_ellipsoid` is the numerically validated reference (§9) that the MATLAB
`sampleMaxVolEllipse` mirrors line-for-line.

## 9. Validation

The MVE solver — the numerical crux of CHRR — is checked against analytic cases with known
closed-form answers:

- **Unit box** `{-1 <= x_i <= 1}` → unit ball (`E = I`, centre `0`).
- **Scaled box** `{-r_i <= x_i <= r_i}` → axis-aligned ellipsoid `E Eᵀ = diag(r_i²)`.
- **Sheared box** `{-1 <= M x <= 1}` → `E Eᵀ = M⁻¹ M⁻ᵀ` (recovers the linear map).
- **Triangle** (standard simplex) → Steiner inellipse, centre `(1/3, 1/3)`,
  `E Eᵀ = [[1/9, -1/18], [-1/18, 1/9]]`, `det = 1/108` (confirms volume maximisation, §5).

The samplers are then checked end-to-end: every sample satisfies `S v = 0` and the bounds;
chains are reproducible under a fixed seed; and CHRR's marginals on an axis-aligned box are
verified uniform (mean at the midpoint, ~half the mass on each side). See raven-toolbox's
`tests/test_analysis_flux_sampling.py` and RAVEN's `tSampling.m`.
