## `mip_gap` — MILP optimality tolerance

**MATLAB default:** `0.0004` (passed to Gurobi `MIPGap`)
**Python default:** `None` (Gurobi's own default, typically `1e-4`)

The MILP at the core of tINIT and ftINIT minimises the number of reactions
added or removed relative to a template model while maximising consistency with
expression scores. A looser `mip_gap` allows the solver to terminate earlier with
a solution within that percentage of optimal.

**Parameters tested:** `None`, `0.0004`, `0.01`, `0.05`

Test model: synthetic tINIT testModel (linear chain A→B→C→D, 4 reactions with
gene rules g1/g2/g3). This model is too small to expose any difference in MIP gap
quality.

| `mip_gap` | Objective | Reactions kept |
|---|---|---|
| `None` | 21.0 | identical |
| `0.0004` | 21.0 | identical |
| `0.01` | 21.0 | identical |
| `0.05` | 21.0 | identical |

The test model is solved to the global optimum in < 0.1 s regardless of gap;
the MIP gap parameter only matters when solving a hard instance where the branch-
and-bound tree is large.

**Genome-scale answer (2026-06-2x, Human-GEM HCT116 — see
[init_param_calibration.md](../studies/init-param-calibration.md)):** this was
run already; it just hadn't been cross-referenced from this file. Findings:
- ftINIT single step: solve time is flat across the gap (model build dominates),
  so `mip_gap=0.001` is nearly free and reproduces the tightest-gap model exactly
  (Jaccard 1.0).
- ftINIT full genome-scale pipeline: **does** benefit from a looser gap —
  `mip_gap=0.01` is ~37% faster than `0.001` at Jaccard 0.995 (essentially the
  same model).
- tINIT (`get_init_model`): `mip_gap=0.001` for stability, `0.01` for ~30% faster
  at ~3% reaction-set drift.

**Decision: keep `mip_gap=None`** (Gurobi's default `MIPGap≈1e-4` is already at
least as tight as the measured-good `0.001`). Docstring guidance updated in
`run_init`/`run_ftinit` to cite the measured genome-scale numbers above instead
of MATLAB's never-independently-tested `0.0004`.

## `time_limit` — MILP per-step wall-clock cap

**MATLAB default:** 5000 ms (5 s) per MILP step inside `run_init`/`run_ftinit`
**Python default:** `None` (no cap)

tINIT and ftINIT solve one MILP per expression category (ftINIT) or a single large
MILP (tINIT). MATLAB caps each solve at 5 seconds, returning the best solution found
within that time. For hard instances this can mean a sub-optimal reaction set.

**Measured solve times (2026-06-20, synthetic toy model):** < 0.1 s — not informative.

**Genome-scale answer:** also already measured, in the same
[init_param_calibration.md](../studies/init-param-calibration.md) robustness
study. This is the one place the two toolboxes' choices both turn out to be
wrong in the same direction (uncapped) or too aggressive (MATLAB's fixed 5 s):
genome-scale solves in that study routinely took 42–901 s depending on
configuration, and one severely-degraded-input case ran **>75 minutes**
uncapped before being killed — MATLAB's 5 s would truncate genome-scale solves
far too early for a useful incumbent; Python's `None` has a real, observed
runaway-time failure mode under hard/degraded input. The study's own working
value for genome-scale ftINIT is a `time_limit` of **≈120–600 s/step**; its
tINIT harness used **400 s**.

**Decision: keep `time_limit=None` as the code default** (still correct for
small/medium models, and for genome-scale runs on clean data where a step-0
build dominates anyway — see [init_param_calibration.md](../studies/init-param-calibration.md) §1.1). Docstring
guidance in `run_init`/`run_ftinit` updated to cite the measured 120–600 s
(ftINIT) / 400 s (tINIT) working values instead of MATLAB's untested 5 s, and to
flag the >75 min uncapped failure mode explicitly so users degrading input
quality know to set a cap.

## `allow_excretion` in `get_init_model`

See [manipulation.md](manipulation.md) for the full benchmark. Summary:
- Effect is **zero** at default `prod_weight=0.5`
- Was inconsistent with `run_init`/`run_ftinit` (both default to `False`)
- **Decision: `get_init_model` default changed to `False`** — done 2026-06-20, `6f3b57c`

## `big_m` in `run_ftinit`

**Parameter:** `big_m=100.0` (Python and MATLAB)

**Benchmark (2026-06-21): yeast-GEM prep_init_model flux bounds after rescaling**

`prep_init_model` calls `rescale_for_init` to normalise stoichiometric coefficients
(mean |coeff| → 1 per reaction), then **explicitly resets all bounds to ±1000**.

```
yeast-GEM (4102 reactions):
  After prep_init_model: 3078 reactions
  After rescale_for_init: max UB (finite) = 1000.00
  Reactions with UB > 100 (finite): 3061 / 3078
```

At first glance this looks like `big_m=100` is too small (3061 reactions have
UB=1000 while big_m=100). But reading the `ftinit.py` module docstring explains
why it is intentional:

> `big_m` caps a *scored* reaction's flux in its on/off (direction) constraint —
> using a fixed 100 rather than the reaction's ±1000 bound keeps the LP relaxation
> tight (what makes the genome-scale MILP tractable). Free / essential reactions
> keep their real bounds.

The key points:
1. **big_m is not a flux maximum** — it is an LP relaxation tightener. A Big-M
   constraint `v ≤ big_m × y` that is smaller than the variable bound (1000)
   makes the LP relaxation closer to the integer solution, dramatically reducing
   solve time for genome-scale MILPs.
2. **Essential and free reactions are unaffected** — they retain ±1000 bounds.
   Only *scored* reactions are capped by big_m.
3. **Stoichiometric rescaling shifts typical fluxes to O(1)** — after normalising
   stoichiometry (mean |coeff| = 1 per reaction), the biologically relevant flux
   range shifts from O(1000) to O(1). `big_m=100` >> `force_on=0.1` (the minimum
   flux to count as "on"), so the indicator binary correctly distinguishes on (flux
   ≥ 0.1) from off (flux = 0) without being artificially binding.
4. **MATLAB RAVEN also uses big_m=100** — confirming this is an intentional design
   decision, not an oversight.

**Decision: ✓ keep `big_m=100.0`.** Intentional LP-tightening parameter that
matches MATLAB RAVEN. The `rescale_for_init` normalisation means that the effective
dynamic range of scored-reaction fluxes is O(1), not O(1000), making big_m=100
a valid and appropriate relaxation tightener. Free and essential reactions are
not constrained by big_m and retain their full ±1000 bounds.

## Scoring parameters (`factor`, `max_score`, `min_score`)

These control how RNA expression values are converted to INIT gene scores.
**Correction (2026-08-28):** this section previously documented the formula as
`log2(TPM)`; the actual implementation (`src/raven_toolbox/init/score.py`,
confirmed directly) and RAVEN's own `scoreComplexModel.m` both use the natural
logarithm, not log2:

```
score = clip(factor × ln(level / reference), min_score, max_score)
```

**Parameters:** `factor=5.0`, `max_score=10.0`, `min_score=-5.0`
(Python and MATLAB both use these values.) **This section previously attributed
these to "Wang et al. 2012", which was checked and could not be confirmed** —
neither raven-toolbox's nor RAVEN's own source cites a paper for this formula,
and the one "Wang 2012" metabolic-modelling paper found (the mCADRE method)
uses a different, categorical scoring approach, not this continuous log-ratio
formula. Treat this as RAVEN's own formula with no confirmed literature source.

Both implementations use the same values, so there is no cross-implementation
disagreement to test — but the source of the specific numbers (5, 10, -5) is
open, and worth resolving if the origin is known.
