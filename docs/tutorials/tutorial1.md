# Tutorial 1 — Import a GEM, set parameters and run FBA

This short introduction shows how to load a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM),
set reaction constraints and an objective function, run an optimization through
flux balance analysis (FBA), and visualise the resulting fluxes.

The example uses a GEM for the filamentous fungus *Penicillium chrysogenum*
(`iAL1006`), provided as the SBML file `iAL1006 v1.00.xml`.

!!! note
    Importing the model performs a number of structural checks. With this model
    there is only one warning, that the formula for the metabolite LPE could not
    be parsed. This is expected and can be ignored.

## Step by step

### 1. Import the model

`importModel` imports the model from SBML and performs a number of structural
checks (such as for incorrectly written equations or illegal characters). The
`false` flag imports the model with exchange reactions in their "closed" form —
unsuited for modelling, but useful for quality-control steps.

```matlab
model = importModel('iAL1006 v1.00.xml', false);
printModelStats(model, true, true);   % list dead-end reactions / unconnected mets
```

The model contains 1632 reactions, 1395 metabolites and 1006 genes.

### 2. Simplify the model

Mass balancing is done around the *internal* metabolites. The "unconstrained"
(boundary) metabolites that let the system take up or excrete compounds must be
removed before simulating. `simplifyModel` also groups linear reactions and
deletes reactions that cannot carry flux.

```matlab
model = simplifyModel(model, true, false, true, true);
```

The model now contains 1305 reactions, 1037 metabolites and 1006 genes.

### 3. Set constraints and an objective, then solve

As a first validation, compute the theoretical yield of CO₂ from glucose. The
supplied model already allows uptake of phosphate, sulfate, NH3, O2 and the
co-factor precursors thiamin and pimelate. Use `setParam` to cap glucose uptake
at 1 mmol/gDW/h, block ethanol uptake, and set CO₂ production as the objective.

```matlab
model = setParam(model, 'ub', {'glcIN' 'etohIN'}, [1 0]);
model = setParam(model, 'obj', {'co2OUT'}, 1);
sol = solveLP(model);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, true, 10^-7);   % exchange fluxes only
```

The solution structure contains `.f` (the objective value), `.stat` (1 on
success) and `.x` (the flux through each reaction). The system takes up 1
glucose and 6 O₂ while producing 6 CO₂ and 6 H₂O.

### 4. Clean up loops

Printing all fluxes (set the third argument to `false`) shows many reactions at
±1000 because of loops in the solution. Passing `1` as the second argument to
`solveLP` minimises the sum of fluxes for a more interpretable result.

```matlab
printFluxes(model, sol.x, false, 10^-7);   % all fluxes
sol = solveLP(model, 1);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, false, 10^-7);
```

Now far fewer reactions are active.

### 5. Optimise for growth and compare carbon sources

To study growth, change the objective to biomass production (`bmOUT`). The
growth rate on glucose is 0.084/h, and the system now also requires sulfate,
phosphate, NH3, thiamin and pimelate. Compare with growth on ethanol, using
three times the molar flux (ethanol has 2 carbons rather than 6). The `eq` flag
sets the lower and upper bound to the same value.

```matlab
model = setParam(model, 'obj', {'bmOUT'}, 1);
sol = solveLP(model, 1);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, true, 10^-7);

% Growth on ethanol instead of glucose (3× the molar flux, 2 C vs 6 C)
modelETH = setParam(model, 'eq', {'glcIN' 'etohIN'}, [0 3]);
solETH = solveLP(modelETH, 1);
printFluxes(modelETH, solETH.x, true, 10^-7);
```

### 6. Investigate the changes

`compareFluxes` takes two flux distributions and reports every reaction whose
flux changed, largest change first, labelling the ones that were turned on,
turned off or reversed direction. The first call considers changes above
0.5 mmol/gDW/h; the second restricts the view to ATP metabolism by naming the
metabolites of interest.

```matlab
res = compareFluxes(modelETH, sol.x, solETH.x, 'cutoff', 0.5);
compareFluxes(modelETH, sol.x, solETH.x, 'cutoff', 0.4, 'metaboliteList', {'ATP'});
```

The printed table is capped at 20 rows, but `res.changed` holds every changed
reaction and `res.turnedOn` / `res.turnedOff` / `res.flipped` list those that
switched state.

By drilling down this way you can understand the flux redistributions that give
rise to different phenotypes — for example, on glucose ATP is generated in
glycolysis, whereas on ethanol it involves acetate.
