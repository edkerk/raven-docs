# Tutorial 5 — Reconstruct a GEM from KEGG

This exercise creates a model from KEGG, based on protein sequences in a FASTA
file, and runs some functionality checks on the result. The example organism is
*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

Unlike Tutorials 1–4, this is more of a **showcase**: its main purpose is to
serve as a scaffold you can adapt to reconstruct a GEM for any organism.

!!! note "Runtime"
    *De novo* reconstruction performs sequence searches against large HMM
    databases. Building the model takes up to 20–35 minutes on macOS and Unix
    systems and 40–55 minutes on Windows, depending on your hardware and the
    size of the target organism's proteome. `gapReport` can take several to many
    hours, depending on the number of gaps in the model.

## Step by step

### 1. Reconstruct from KEGG

Start by downloading trained Hidden Markov Models for eukaryotes. This can be
done automatically or manually from the RAVEN Wiki in its GitHub repository;
here the archive `euk90_kegg105` is picked for automatic download. See the RAVEN
Wiki for more information regarding preparation of such an archive.

`getKEGGModelForOrganism` then creates a model for *S. cerevisiae* from the
whole-proteome FASTA (`sce.fa`). The parameters are set to exclude general or
unclear reactions and reactions with undefined stoichiometry. Type
`help getKEGGModelForOrganism` to see what the different parameters are for.

```matlab
model=getKEGGModelForOrganism('sce','sce.fa','euk90_kegg105','output',false,false,false,false,10^-30,0.8,0.3,-1);
disp(model);
```

The resulting model should contain around 1589 reactions, 1600 metabolites and
836 genes. Small variations are possible since it is a heuristic algorithm, and
different KEGG versions give slightly different results.

### 2. Remove reactions that make something from nothing

A first control is that the model should not be able to produce any metabolites
without uptake of some metabolites. This commonly happens when metabolites have
a different meaning in different reactions. `removeBadRxns` tries to find and
remove such reactions in an automated manner; type `help removeBadRxns` for
details.

```matlab
[newModel, removedRxns]=removeBadRxns(model);
```

This reports that H⁺ can be made even if no reactions were unbalanced. Protons
are particularly problematic since it is rather arbitrary at which pH the
formulas are written. For this analysis the protons can be ignored and fixed
later, so rerun while allowing H⁺ to be produced.

```matlab
[newModel, removedRxns]=removeBadRxns(model,1,{'H+'},true);
disp(removedRxns);
```

Only one reaction was removed because it enabled the model to produce something
from nothing. Since it is only one reaction, it is worthwhile to look into it in
more detail.

### 3. Investigate the problematic reaction

According to KEGG, the removed reaction is a general polymer reaction. Use
`makeSomething` to look at the flux distributions in more detail and find out if
there is a better alternative to delete.

```matlab
[fluxes, metabolite]=makeSomething(model,{'H+'},true);
model.metNames(metabolite)
printFluxes(model, fluxes, false, [], [],'%rxnID (%rxnName):\n\t%eqn: %flux\n')
```

This shows the model could produce H₂O, and results in quite a lot of fluxes to
look through. It is easier if the elementally balanced reactions are excluded.
Since water was produced, only look at the reactions unbalanced for oxygen
(column 6 of the elemental balance).

```matlab
balanceStructure=getElementalBalance(model);
goodOnes=balanceStructure.leftComp(:,6)==balanceStructure.rightComp(:,6);
printFluxes(removeReactions(model,goodOnes), fluxes(~goodOnes), false, [], [],'%rxnID (%rxnName):\n\t%eqn: %flux\n');
```

There is still a good number of reactions. Leave only the reactions which
involve amylose or starch, from one of the problematic reactions identified
earlier.

```matlab
printFluxes(model, fluxes, false, [], [],'%rxnID (%rxnName):\n\t%eqn: %flux\n',{'Amylose';'Starch'});
```

There are two elementally unbalanced reactions, including the one identified by
`removeBadRxns`. They contradict each other: the first shows that amylose and
starch are interconvertible, while the second shows that amylose contains one
less glucose unit than starch. Such general reactions should be fixed manually.
Trusting `removeBadRxns`, delete `R02110`.

```matlab
model=removeReactions(model,'R02110');
```

### 4. Check consumption and add uptakes

The model can no longer make something from nothing. Check whether it can
consume something without any output.

```matlab
[solution, metabolite]=consumeSomething(model,{'H+'},true);
model.metNames(metabolite)
```

Nothing is consumed without output, so that is good. Now add some uptakes and
see what the model can produce.

```matlab
[~, J]=ismember({'D-Glucose';'H2O';'Orthophosphate';'Oxygen';'NH3';'Sulfate'},model.metNames);
[model, addedRxns]=addExchangeRxns(model,'in',J);
```

`canProduce` reports which metabolites can be produced given these uptakes. It
allows output of all metabolites — which does not happen in a real cell, but is
very useful for functionality testing.

```matlab
I=canProduce(model);
fprintf('%d%%\n', round(sum(I)/numel(model.mets)*100));
```

Around 31% of the metabolites could be synthesized. It is not directly clear
whether this is high or low — many metabolites should not be possible to
synthesize from those simple precursors.

### 5. Fill gaps using the full KEGG model

Try to fill gaps using the full KEGG model to see if that gives a significantly
higher number. `getModelFromKEGG` retrieves the full KEGG model. It is
associated with more than 6,400,000 genes that are not used for gap-filling, so
they are removed to make this a little faster.

```matlab
keggModel=getModelFromKEGG([],false,false,false,false);
keggModel=rmfield(keggModel,'genes');
keggModel=rmfield(keggModel,'rxnGeneMat');
```

It is already known that there are some unbalanced reactions in KEGG. Only the
balanced ones are used for gap-filling.

```matlab
balanceStructure=getElementalBalance(keggModel);
keggModel=removeReactions(keggModel,balanceStructure.balanceStatus~=1,true,true);
```

`fillGaps` with these settings tries to include reactions so that there is flux
through all reactions in the model. The first flag says that production of all
metabolites should be allowed.

```matlab
params.relGap=0.6; %Lower number for a more exhaustive search
params.printReport=true;
[newConnected, cannotConnect, addedRxns, newModel, exitFlag]=fillGaps(model,keggModel,true,false,false,[],params);
```

The results show that `fillGaps` could connect around 29 reactions
(`newConnected`) by including around 41 reactions from the KEGG model
(`addedRxns`). These should of course be checked manually to confirm that they
exist in yeast, but here it is assumed they all occur in yeast.

### 6. Report on connectivity

Continue to improve the connectivity of the model by identifying metabolites
that should be connected. `gapReport` gives a convenient overview of how
connected the model is, together with a lot of useful data.

```matlab
[noFluxRxns, noFluxRxnsRelaxed, subGraphs, notProducedMets, minToConnect,...
    neededForProductionMat]=gapReport(newModel);
```

The results show that 532 from 1634 reactions cannot carry flux. Because output
is allowed for all metabolites, it calculates 532 in both cases. 543 from 1617
metabolites cannot be synthesized from the supplied precursors. There are 6
subnetworks in the model, of which 1605 from 1617 metabolites belong to the
first one.

`gapReport` also prints the metabolites to connect: to enable net production of
all metabolites, a total of 322 metabolites must be connected, with the top
ranked one being Acyl-CoA (which connects 162 metabolites). Connecting only the
top 10 in the list already connects 271/543 (50%) of them. This is a very useful
way of directing the gap-filling tasks to where they are of greatest use.

### 7. Add minimal-media uptakes and iterate

The list reveals that yeast cannot grow on only the substrates defined so far;
it requires some other precursors for co-factor synthesis as well. Add uptake
reactions for the minimal-media constituents needed for yeast to grow.

```matlab
[~, J]=ismember({'4-Aminobenzoate';'Riboflavin';'Thiamine';'Biotin';'Folate';'Nicotinate';'Zymosterol';'Choline'},newModel.metNames);
[newModel, addedRxns]=addExchangeRxns(newModel,'in',J);
```

Rerun `gapReport` and use the output for targeting the gap-filling efforts. Note
that only some info is printed; most of it is available in the output
structures. Work like this in an iterative manner until the model is of
sufficient quality.
