# Tutorial 4 — Fix an erroneous model

The power of GEMs comes from their size — but that size makes errors almost
inevitable, whether you build a model yourself or use someone else's. This
exercise is a systematic round of quality control on a deliberately broken
version of the small yeast model, `smallYeastBad.yml`.

Model validation is **iterative**: some errors only surface once others are
fixed. The RAVEN philosophy is that it is more valuable to try to make a model
do something it *should not* (e.g. create mass from nothing) than to test only
for what it should do.

`tutorial4.m` leaves several gaps for you to fill; the completed version is in
`tutorial4_solutions.m`. Many of these checks are also wrapped by the
`gapReport` function, but doing them step by step is far more instructive.

!!! note
    Many of these changes are easier to do in the Excel sheet. They are done
    here in code just to avoid having several model files. It is assumed that
    you have already completed Tutorials 2–3 and are somewhat familiar with
    linear programming.

## Step by step

### 1. Can the model make something from nothing?

Import the broken model, close all uptake, and maximise the sum of the producing
exchange reactions. Any non-zero solution is a problem.

```matlab
model = readYAMLmodel('smallYeastBad.yml');
model = setParam(model, 'eq', {'glcIN', 'o2IN'}, [0 0]);
model = setParam(model, 'obj', {'acOUT' 'biomassOUT' 'co2OUT' 'ethOUT' 'glyOUT'}, [1 1 1 1 1]);
sol = solveLP(model);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, true); %Nothing produced, good
```

### 2. Provoke hidden errors

An error may be masked because it costs energy or redox power. Add temporary
"free" cofactor reactions (ATP ⇌ ADP + Pᵢ, and similar for NADH/NADPH) to
provoke the model, then minimise the sum of fluxes for an interpretable
solution:

```matlab
rxns.rxns = {'FREE_ATP'; 'FREE_NADH'; 'FREE_NADPH'};
rxns.equations = {'ATP <=> ADP + phosphate'; 'NAD(+) <=> NADH'; 'NADP(+) <=> NADPH'};
model = addRxns(model, rxns, 2, 'c');
sol = solveLP(model, 1);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, false, [], [], '%rxnID (%rxnName):%flux\n\t%eqn\n');
```

??? success "Answer to Question 2 — production of ethanol from nothing"
    Lots of ethanol is produced. `ADH1` should only produce one unit of
    ethanol. Change its equation with
    `model = changeRxns(model, 'ADH1', 'acetaldehyde[c] + NADH[c] => ethanol[c] + NAD(+)[c]', 3);`

### 3. Allow every metabolite to be excreted

Add a second column to `model.b` so RAVEN treats it as lower/upper bounds on the
equality constraints — letting anything be excreted. This exposes errors that
need a partner metabolite to be dumped.

```matlab
model.b = [model.b inf(numel(model.b), 1)];
sol = solveLP(model, 1);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, false, 10^-5, [], '%rxnID (%rxnName):\n\t%eqn\n\t%flux\n');
```

??? success "Answer to Question 3 — two unbalanced reactions"
    By looking at the reactions which were unbalanced and that were in the flux
    list, one can see that two reactions should each result in only one unit of
    product:

    - `FBP` should give one unit of F6P: change it to
      `beta-D-fructofuranose 1,6-bisphosphate[c] => beta-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate[c] + phosphate[c]`.
    - `PFK` should give one unit of F16P: change it to
      `ATP[c] + beta-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate[c] => ADP[c] + beta-D-fructofuranose 1,6-bisphosphate[c]`.

    Apply each with `changeRxns(model, …, 3)`.

### 4. `canConsume`

Set all uptakes and production to 0, drop the excretion column again, and check
which metabolites can be consumed without any production:

```matlab
model = setParam(model, 'eq', getExchangeRxns(model), 0);
model.b = model.b(:, 1);
I = canConsume(model);
disp(model.mets(I)); %These 12 metabolites can be consumed without any production
```

`canConsume` reports the metabolites the model can consume even when no
production is allowed. Allow all uptake again, then force the uptake of one of
them — here CO2 — and study the fluxes (a negative output means input):

```matlab
model.b = [ones(numel(model.b), 1) * -1000 model.b];
model = setParam(model, 'eq', {'co2OUT'}, -1);
sol = solveLP(model);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, false, 10^-5, [], '%rxnID (%rxnName):\n\t%eqn\n\t%flux\n'); %Now it works
```

??? success "Answer to Question 4 — `PDC` is missing a product"
    `PDC` converts pyruvate (3 carbons) to acetaldehyde (2 carbons) without any
    other products — CO2 is missing. This would be simpler to change in the
    Excel file (or using `changeRxns`), but as an exercise one can add the
    cytosolic CO2 coefficient directly to the stoichiometric matrix:

    ```matlab
    Irxn = ismember(model.rxns, 'PDC');
    Imet = ismember(model.mets, 'CO2_c');
    model.S(Imet, Irxn) = 1; %The coefficient is 1.0
    constructEquations(model, Irxn)
    ```

    The solution is now infeasible, meaning it is no longer possible to force
    uptake of CO2 without any output.

### 5. Gap-filling against a reference model

`tutorial4.m` also imports a reference model to draw reactions from, allows all
excretion, and reports gaps before filling them:

```matlab
model = readYAMLmodel('smallYeastBad.yml');
refModel = readYAMLmodel('smallYeast.yml');
model.b = [model.b inf(numel(model.b), 1)];
sol = solveLP(model, 1);
printFluxes(model, sol.x, false, 10^-5, [], '%rxnID (%rxnName):\n\t%eqn\n\t%flux\n');
I = canConsume(model);
disp(model.mets(I));
gapReport(model, {refModel});

[newConnected, cannotConnect, addedRxns, newModel] = fillGaps(model, {refModel}, false);
disp(addedRxns);
disp(newConnected);
disp(cannotConnect);
```

`gapReport` automates this whole quality-control workflow, while `fillGaps`
adds reactions from the reference model (here the Tutorial 3 small yeast model)
to connect the remaining gaps.
