# Worked protocol — *Hansenula polymorpha*

A complete homology-based reconstruction of `hanpo-GEM`, followed from start to
finish: template models in, a growing methylotrophic draft out. This is the
published pipeline, in order, with the judgement calls left visible.

It is the counterpart to the [user guide](../guide/index.md). The numbered guide
pages answer "how do I do this one thing"; this protocol answers "what does a
whole reconstruction look like, and in what order".

!!! note "MATLAB only, and not executed here"
    The protocol predates the dual-language guide and its steps are MATLAB. Its
    commands are also not run by the documentation build, unlike the numbered
    guide pages — several steps take hours and need data that is not shipped
    with this site.

## The steps

| | |
|---|---|
| [Introduction](reconstruction.md) | what is being built, and from what |
| [Materials and installation](materials.md) | software, databases and input files |
| [Import template models](template-models.md) | the *S. cerevisiae* and *R. toruloides* models the draft is built from |
| [Draft from homology](homology.md) | BLAST and `getModelFromHomology` — see also [18. Reconstruction from homology](../guide/homology.md) |
| [Biomass composition](biomass.md) | measuring and assembling the biomass equation |
| [Curation of lipid reactions](lipid-curation.md) | the part that never generalises |
| [Gap-filling](gap-filling.md) | closing the holes — see also [13. Gap-filling](../guide/gap-filling.md) |
| [Save and simulate](simulation.md) | writing the model out and checking it grows |
| [Manual curation](manual-curation.md) | what no function does for you |
| [Anticipated results](anticipated-results.md) | what the finished model should look like |
