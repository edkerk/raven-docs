# 3.9 Manual curation

A draft GEM always requires manual curation to become a high-quality model.
Curation can mean correcting gene associations, adding or removing reactions, and
moving reactions between compartments — all aiming for a more accurate
description of the *in vivo* network. (For comparison, the *S. cerevisiae* model
has been continuously curated since 2003.)

## Replace template genes with target homologs

Gap-filling adds reactions from the templates **without** searching for homology
of the associated genes, so the draft contains *S. cerevisiae* and
*R. toruloides* genes that should be replaced by *H. polymorpha* homologs. List
the reactions still carrying an *R. toruloides* gene:

```matlab
rhtoRxns = find(contains(model.grRules, 'RHTO'));
model.rxnNames(rhtoRxns);
model.grRules(rhtoRxns);
```

By literature search and BLAST, gene `RHTO_03911` (oleoyl-CoA desaturase,
reaction `y300009`) was found to have the homolog `Hanpo2_15704`. Curate the gene
association:

```matlab
model = changeGrRules(model, 'y300009', 'Hanpo2_15704', true);
model = deleteUnusedGenes(model);
```

## Add methanol assimilation

*H. polymorpha* is a methylotroph able to assimilate methanol, but the draft
lacks the required pathway. Five reactions are needed; reactions 3–5 (formate
dehydrogenase, peroxisomal catalase, dihydroxyacetone kinase) are already
present, so two are added manually:

1. **methanol oxidase** — `methanol[p] + oxygen[p] => formaldehyde[p] + hydrogen peroxide[p]`
2. **dihydroxyacetone synthase** — `formaldehyde[p] + D-xylulose 5-phosphate[p] => glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate[p] + glycerone[p]`

A `rxnsToAdd` structure collects all the information for the new reactions, which
are then added with `addRxns`:

```matlab
rxnsToAdd.rxns      = {'MOX', 'DAS'};
rxnsToAdd.equations = {'methanol[p] + oxygen[p] => formaldehyde[p] + hydrogen peroxide[p]', ...
                       'formaldehyde[p] + D-xylulose 5-phosphate[p] => glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate[p] + glycerone[p]'};
rxnsToAdd.rxnNames  = {'methanol oxidase', 'dihydroxyacetone synthase'};
rxnsToAdd.lb        = [0, 0];
rxnsToAdd.ub        = [1000, 1000];
rxnsToAdd.eccodes   = {'1.1.3.13', '2.2.1.3'};
rxnsToAdd.grRules   = {'Hanpo2_76277', 'Hanpo2_95557'};
rxnsToAdd.rxnNotes  = {'Methanol metabolism reaction added by manual curation', ...
                       'Methanol metabolism reaction added by manual curation'};
model = addRxns(model, rxnsToAdd, 3, '', true, true);
```

A few transport and exchange reactions complete the pathway: methanol (and
glucose) exchange, peroxisomal diffusion of O₂ and H₂O, and transport of the
intermediates between cytoplasm and peroxisome:

```matlab
model = addRxnsGenesMets(model, modelSce, {'r_4494', 'r_4391', 'r_1714', 'r_1980', 'r_2098'});
model = addTransport(model, 'c', 'p', {'D-xylulose 5-phosphate' 'methanol' ...
    'glycerone' 'glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate'}, true, false, 't_');
```

## Confirm growth on methanol

Block other carbon sources, allow methanol uptake, and verify growth:

```matlab
model = setParam(model, 'eq', {'r_1808', 'r_1714'}, 0);   % no glycerol/glucose
model = setParam(model, 'lb', 'r_4494', -1);              % allow methanol uptake
sol = solveLP(model, 1);
printFluxes(model, sol.x);

newCommit(model);
```

The draft model is now methylotrophic, in agreement with the literature.
