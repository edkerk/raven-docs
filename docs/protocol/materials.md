# Materials and installation

## Software

This protocol runs in **MATLAB** (R2013b or later; no extra MathWorks toolboxes
required), complemented with software for reconstructing and analysing GEMs.
Most of it is open source or available under an academic license.

| Software | Dependency | Source |
|---|---|---|
| MATLAB | License | <https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html> |
| RAVEN | libSBML, solver | <https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN> |
| COBRA | MATLAB | <https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox> |
| Gurobi | License | <https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/> |
| libSBML | MATLAB | <http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML> |

- **RAVEN** is the toolbox that drives the reconstruction.
- **libSBML** enables import/export of the community-standard SBML (`.xml`)
  format.
- A **linear-programming solver** is needed for simulation. This protocol uses
  **Gurobi** (free academic license); RAVEN can alternatively use the
  open-source **GLPK** solver bundled with COBRA.

See [Installation](../installation/raven.md) for the full setup.

## Files

Homology-based reconstruction requires files for both the **target** organism
and the **template** organisms.

| File type | Usage | Organism | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| GEM (SBML) | Template network | *S. cerevisiae* | [yeast-GEM v8.3.0](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/releases/tag/v8.3.0) |
| GEM (SBML) | Template network | *R. toruloides* | [rhto-GEM v1.1.2](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/rhto-GEM) |
| Protein FASTA | BLAST | *S. cerevisiae* | hanpo-GEM `data/genomes/sce.faa` |
| Protein FASTA | BLAST | *R. toruloides* | hanpo-GEM `data/genomes/rhto.faa` |
| Protein FASTA | BLAST | *H. polymorpha* | [JGI Hanpo2](https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/Hanpo2/Hanpo2.home.html) |
| DNA FASTA | Biomass curation | *H. polymorpha* | NCBI `GCF_001664045.1_Hanpo2` |
| GenBank | Biomass curation | *H. polymorpha* | NCBI `GCF_001664045.1_Hanpo2` |

For the target organism you need (1) a protein FASTA of all proteins in its
genome, (2) a DNA FASTA for nucleotide ratios, and (3) a GenBank file for
ribonucleotide ratios. For each template you need a protein FASTA and a model
file in SBML format.

!!! important "Matching identifiers"
    For automatic gene matching, the protein FASTA and the model file of each
    template **must use the same gene identifiers**.

All required files for *H. polymorpha* are provided in the
[hanpo-GEM](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/hanpo-GEM) repository — clone it to
get a local copy.

## Literature data

Model quality improves by leveraging any known metabolic behaviour of the target
organism: macromolecule fractions of biomass, essential/non-essential genes,
usable nutrient sources, and growth rate. A short literature search yields total
protein, lipid and carbohydrate content for *H. polymorpha*, used to set the
biomass stoichiometric coefficients ([Biomass composition](biomass.md)). Where
organism-specific data is missing, values from related organisms can be used.

## 3.1 Install RAVEN

After obtaining the software and files, install RAVEN (see the
[RAVEN Wiki](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/wiki/Installation)). Use
`pathtool` to add the RAVEN, libSBML and Gurobi subfolders to the MATLAB path,
then verify with:

```matlab
checkInstallation
```

A successful run looks like:

```text
*** THE RAVEN TOOLBOX ***

Checking if RAVEN is on the MATLAB path...                                  OK
Checking if it is possible to parse a model in Microsoft Excel format...    OK
Checking if it is possible to import an SBML model using libSBML...         OK
Solver found in preferences... gurobi
Checking if it is possible to solve an LP problem using gurobi...           OK
Checking essential binary executables:
    BLAST+... OK
    DIAMOND... OK
    HMMER... OK
*** checkInstallation complete ***
```

!!! warning
    If `checkInstallation` reports that parsing Excel format **FAILED**,
    uninstall MATLAB's **Text Analytics Toolbox**, which conflicts with RAVEN's
    Excel parser. For support, see the
    [RAVEN issues](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/issues) page.
