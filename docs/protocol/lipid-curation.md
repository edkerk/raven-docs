# 3.5 Curation of lipid reactions

After adjusting the biomass composition it is useful to curate reactions already
known to differ in the target organism. Using the **SLIME** formalism (*Split
Lipids Into Measurable Entities*) to describe lipid metabolism requires curating
the lipid reactions to match the lipids in the biomass reaction.

!!! note "Order matters"
    This step can also be done after gap-filling, but the curation may influence
    the gap-filling result, so it is done first here.

## The SLIME formalism

SLIME captures the flexibility of lipid metabolism while letting you incorporate
measurements of lipid classes and acyl chains. Each lipid species in the biomass
composition is split into pseudometabolites for its **backbone** and **acyl
chains**, which are then gathered into the measured entities:

```text
phosphatidylcholine (1–16:0, 2–18:0) → phosphatidylcholine backbone
                                       + C16:0 chain + C18:0 chain
phosphatidylcholine backbone + triglyceride backbone + … → lipid backbone
C16:0 chain + C18:0 chain + C18:1 chain + …             → lipid chain
lipid backbone + lipid chain                            → lipid
```

## Apply the template reactions

Template reactions are provided in the repository's `data/reconstruction/`
folder. The protocol reads these templates and applies them with
`addLipidReactions` and `addSLIMEreactions`. Conceptually:

```matlab
model = addLipidReactions(template, model, modelSce);   % lipid + transport reactions
model = addSLIMEreactions(template, model, modelSce);   % SLIME split reactions
```

In the full script, three template files are read (`lipidTemplates.txt`,
`lipidTransport.txt`, `SLIMERtemplates.txt`), reorganised into a `template`
structure, and any pre-existing matching or `SLIME rxn` reactions are removed
first so the curated set replaces them cleanly. To reduce complexity, only a
subset of possible acyl-chain distributions is included.

## Scale the acyl chains

After gap-filling (next section) it becomes apparent that the provided acyl-chain
and lipid-class levels are not fully compatible — one of the two must be scaled
for a functional model. Assuming the lipid-class measurements are technically
more reliable, the acyl-chain data is scaled:

```matlab
model = scaleLipids(model, 'tails');
```

The model now has the lipid reactions needed to support a flux toward lipid
biosynthesis.
