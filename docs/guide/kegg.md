# 19. Reconstruction from KEGG

[18. Reconstruction from homology](homology.md) needs a template model of a
related organism. KEGG needs none: its orthology groups (KOs) are already tied to
reactions, so annotating a genome with KOs gives you a draft directly. Which
route you take depends on one thing: whether your organism is already in KEGG.

!!! note "These examples are not run by the documentation build"
    Every other page in this guide is executed on each commit and its output
    checked. This one is not. A KEGG reconstruction downloads tens to hundreds of
    megabytes and takes minutes even once that is cached, which is too much for a
    per-commit check. The numbers below come from real runs and are quoted with
    their timings, measured on an ordinary laptop.

### Functions on this page

| MATLAB | Python | |
|---|---|---|
| `getKEGGModelForOrganism` | `get_kegg_model_for_organism_from_artefacts` | draft from an organism's KEGG annotation |
| `getKEGGModelForOrganism` (with `fastaFile`) | `get_kegg_model_from_sequences` | draft from an HMM search of your proteins |
| `getModelFromKEGG` | `build_reference_model` | assemble and cache the global KEGG model |
| `getPhylDist` | `PhylDist` | phylogenetic distance, used to weight the search |

## 19.1 When the organism is already in KEGG

If KEGG has your species (`sce` for *S. cerevisiae*), its gene-to-KO assignments
are already made, and no sequence search is needed. This is the fast route, and
the one to prefer when it applies.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    model = getKEGGModelForOrganism('sce', ...
        'dataDir', fullfile(tempdir, 'kegg118_eukaryotes'));
    ```

    Without a `fastaFile`, the reconstruction runs from the organism
    abbreviation alone and no sequence search happens, so the HMM library is not
    fetched; the download is guarded on a FASTA being supplied. What it does need
    is the global KEGG model, which `getModelFromKEGG` supplies. On first use
    there is no `keggModel.mat` to load, so it downloads the published artefacts,
    the gene-free reference model plus the KO, reaction and organism-gene tables,
    assembles them, and caches the result. That first build takes a while and
    needs a few hundred MB of disk; later calls load the cached file directly.

    This route ignores every setting except `keepSpontaneous`,
    `keepUndefinedStoich`, `keepIncomplete` and `keepGeneral`, since the cut-offs
    and phylogenetic weighting only apply to a sequence search.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.reconstruction.kegg import (
        get_kegg_model_for_organism_from_artefacts,
    )

    model = get_kegg_model_for_organism_from_artefacts("sce")
    print(f"{len(model.reactions)} rxns, {len(model.metabolites)} mets, "
          f"{len(model.genes)} genes")
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    1357 rxns, 1502 mets, 838 genes
    ```

    The artefacts (a reference model and three tables, about 47 MB) are fetched
    from the `kegg118` raven-data release on first use and cached. Expect around
    five minutes for the first run and much the same afterwards: the download is
    not the slow part, assembling the draft from the tables is.

## 19.2 When it is not

For an organism KEGG has never seen, the KO assignments have to be made from
sequence. Both toolboxes search your proteins against a library of profile HMMs,
one per KO, trained on either prokaryotic or eukaryotic sequences.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    model = getKEGGModelForOrganism('hpo', ...
        'fastaFile', 'hanpo.faa', ...
        'dataDir', fullfile(tempdir, 'kegg118_eukaryotes'), ...
        'outDir', fullfile(tempdir, 'hanpo_hmm'));
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.reconstruction.kegg import get_kegg_model_from_sequences

    model = get_kegg_model_from_sequences("hanpo.faa", domain="eukaryotes")
    ```

This is the expensive route. The eukaryotic HMM library alone is **129 MB
compressed**, and `hmmsearch` against every KO takes tens of minutes to hours for
a full proteome, which is why `outDir` exists in the MATLAB version: results are
kept per-KO so an interrupted run can resume rather than start again.

The organism id still matters even here. It sets the phylogenetic distance used
to weight the KO assignments, so pick the closest relative KEGG does have.
`maxPhylDist` decides how far the search may reach: `-1` restricts it to the
same domain, and a positive value admits organisms out to that distance.

Three cut-offs shape the assignment. `cutOff` is the HMMER significance a hit
needs at all. `minScoreRatioKO` drops genes that fit a KO far worse than the
best gene in it, and `minScoreRatioG` drops KOs that fit a gene far worse than
that gene's best KO; the two prune the same matrix from opposite sides. Their
defaults were measured rather than inherited, and the
[KEGG HMM cut-off study](../parameter-tuning/studies/kegg-hmm-cutoff-calibration.md)
records which of them actually moves the result.

## 19.3 What a KEGG draft is

Genome-scale in size, and unlike a working model in every other respect.

```text title="the sce draft, measured"
reactions:     1357
metabolites:   1502
genes:          838
compartments:  1 (everything is in 's')
exchange rxns:   0
objective:       none
```

**There are no compartments.** KEGG describes reactions, not cell biology, so
every metabolite lands in one undifferentiated space. A KEGG draft cannot
distinguish mitochondrial from cytosolic anything until you localise it;
see [16. Combining and simplifying](combining.md) for the reverse operation, and
what is lost by it.

The flags decide how inclusive the draft is. `keepIncomplete` /
`keep_incomplete` keeps reactions whose KO assignment is only partial;
`keepUndefinedStoich` / `keep_undefined_stoich` keeps reactions with `n` or `x`
in their stoichiometry, which cannot be balanced as written. Turning both off:

```text title="keep_incomplete=False, keep_undefined_stoich=False"
1348 rxns, 827 genes   (from 1357 and 838)
```

A change of nine reactions on this organism. The size of the effect depends on
the organism, so measure it rather than assuming it. `keepGeneral` /
`keep_general` is off by default for a better reason: general reactions are placeholders like "an alcohol
+ NAD+", and admitting them produces a network that appears to do far more than
it can.

!!! warning "What can go wrong"
    - **Expecting a model.** No biomass reaction, no exchanges, no compartments,
      no medium. What you have is a reaction inventory with gene associations.
    - **Trusting the KO assignment.** A KO is an orthology group, not a
      demonstrated activity in your organism, and a partial HMM hit is weaker
      still.
    - **Undefined stoichiometry.** Reactions with `n` or `x` coefficients cannot
      be mass-balanced. They are kept by default because dropping them loses real
      chemistry, but they will trip up
      [9. Quality control](quality-control.md) later.
    - **Version drift.** The artefacts are built from a specific KEGG release,
      `kegg118` here. Rebuilding a year later with a different release gives a
      different model, so record which one you used.
