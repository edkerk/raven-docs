# 20. Engineering targets

Two questions sit behind most strain-design work. Which reactions would have to
change for the cell to make more of something, and which metabolites sit at the
centre of a transcriptional response. FSEOF answers the first from stoichiometry
alone; reporter metabolites answer the second from expression data.

### Functions on this page

|---|---|---|
| `FSEOF` | `fseof` | reactions whose flux tracks enforced product formation |
| `reporterMetabolites` | `reporter_metabolites` | metabolites surrounded by transcriptional change |

## Setup

`smallYeast.yml` with glucose and oxygen open, growing. Uptake in this model is a
**positive** flux through a `=> metabolite` reaction, so the upper bound opens it.

## 20.1 Which reactions track the product?

FSEOF forces the product exchange to carry progressively more flux, maximising
growth at each step, and records what every other reaction does. A reaction whose
flux rises with the enforced product is an amplification candidate; one that
falls is a knockdown candidate. Ethanol, `ethOUT`, is the product here.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
targets = FSEOF(model, 'biomassOUT', 'ethOUT', 'outputFile', tempname());
fprintf('%d amplification target(s) of %d reactions\n', ...
    sum(targets.logical), numel(model.rxns));
```

```text
14 amplification target(s) of 53 reactions
```

The scan runs `iterations` steps, ten by default, up to `coefficient` times
the theoretical maximum product flux, `0.9` by default. Writing to
`outputFile` keeps the per-reaction table out of the command window; leave it
out and the table prints instead.

`corrThreshold` is the filter that decides what counts as a target: a
reaction is kept only if the absolute Pearson correlation between its flux
and the enforced product flux is at least this value, `0.9` by default.
Alternative optima make individual fluxes jump between steps, and requiring a
nearly linear response is what keeps that noise out of the target list.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from raven_toolbox.analysis import fseof

result = fseof(model, target_rxn="ethOUT", biomass_rxn="biomassOUT")
amplify = (result.targets.target_type == "amplify").sum()
print(f"{amplify} amplification target(s) of {len(model.reactions)} reactions")
print(f"{len(result.targets)} rows in total, both directions")
print(f"enforced flux from {result.enforced[0]:.3f} to {result.enforced[-1]:.3f}")
```

```text
12 amplification target(s) of 53 reactions
38 rows in total, both directions
enforced flux from 0.180 to 1.800
```

The two tabs count different things unless asked not to. `targets.logical`
in MATLAB flags **amplification** targets alone, while `result.targets`
holds every classified reaction, amplification and knockdown, with a
`target_type` column separating them. Both scans use the same defaults:
ten steps, up to 0.9 of the theoretical maximum, correlation at least 0.9.

That leaves 14 against 12, and the remaining two come from the noise
floor. `fseof` discards a flux or a slope below `flux_eps`, `1e-6` by
default; `FSEOF` compares against zero with no tolerance at all, so two
reactions carrying solver noise survive its filter. The
[parameter benchmarks](../parameter-tuning/benchmarks.md) measure that
difference on a genome-scale model, where it admits 21 spurious targets.

`fseof` returns the whole scan rather than only its conclusion. `scan` is the
reactions by enforced-flux-level matrix of fluxes, `enforced` the levels
themselves, and `targets` the classified per-reaction table sorted by score.
`gene_targets` aggregates the same result to genes, which is the form a
strain-design list usually takes.

`correlation_threshold` matches MATLAB's `corrThreshold`, and `flux_eps` is
the tolerance below which a flux or a slope counts as zero. `min_target` sets
the floor of the enforced range; passing the target reaction's flux at the
growth optimum scans from where the cell already is rather than from near
zero.

## 20.2 Reading the scan

A target is only as good as the trend behind it. The scan matrix is what
distinguishes a reaction that rises steadily from one that jumps once and stops.

The slope is the change in a reaction's flux per unit of enforced product. Its
sign says which way to push, and its magnitude says how hard. Neither says the
change is achievable: FSEOF works on the stoichiometry and the bounds, and knows
nothing about regulation, enzyme capacity or toxicity.

## 20.3 Reporter metabolites

The other direction. Given a differential-expression result, which metabolites
have the most transcriptionally-responsive neighbourhood? The algorithm scores
each metabolite from the p-values of the genes catalysing the reactions it takes
part in, and corrects for how many genes that is, so a metabolite in a large
subsystem does not win by size alone.

Real p-values come from a differential-expression analysis. To keep this page
reproducible the ones below are derived from the gene identifiers, so both tabs
compute the same input.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
pvalues = zeros(numel(model.genes), 1);
for i = 1:numel(model.genes)
    pvalues(i) = mod(sum(double(model.genes{i})), 1000) / 1000;
end

repMets = reporterMetabolites(model, model.genes, pvalues);
[~, order] = sort(repMets(1).metPValues);
for i = 1:5
    j = order(i);
    fprintf('  %-8s z %6.3f  p %.4f  genes %d\n', repMets(1).mets{j}, ...
        repMets(1).metZScores(j), repMets(1).metPValues(j), ...
        repMets(1).metNGenes(j));
end
```

```text
  GA3P_c   z  1.484  p 0.0689  genes 8
  X5P_c    z  1.241  p 0.1073  genes 3
  F6P_c    z  1.186  p 0.1179  genes 7

  F16P_c   z  1.117  p 0.1320  genes 4
```

`printResults` prints the top 20 instead, and `outputFile` writes them.
Supplying `geneFoldChanges` adds two further results alongside the full test,
one for the up-regulated genes and one for the down-regulated, so a
metabolite that is only interesting in one direction can be told apart from
one that responds either way.

`reporter_metabolites` returns one result per gene set. Without fold changes
that is a single `"all"` result; with `gene_fold_changes` it is three, adding
`"up"` and `"down"` for the two subsets. Each carries a `table` with the
z-score, p-value and the number of genes behind each metabolite.

Genes the model does not have, and p-values that are missing or outside
`[0, 1]`, are dropped rather than propagated, because one invalid value would
otherwise turn the whole result into `NaN`.
:::
::::

:::{note} Why the two tabs agree to three decimals and not four
The same five metabolites come out in the same order, with z-scores of
1.484 against 1.496 and 1.241 against 1.251. Both toolboxes implement the
same algorithm and the same background correction, but RAVEN estimates the
correction by Monte-Carlo sampling while raven-toolbox evaluates it in
closed form, so RAVEN's figures carry sampling noise and shift slightly
between runs. The ranking is the result; the third decimal is not.

The two also organise the output differently. raven-toolbox reports the
one-sided enrichment p-value and sorts by z-score; RAVEN reports both tails
and sorts by p-value. With a single gene set the orderings coincide, as
above.
:::

:::{warning} What can go wrong
- **Reading FSEOF as a prediction.** It reports what the stoichiometry allows
  when product formation is forced, which is a hypothesis to test, not an
  expected yield.
- **A target list full of noise.** Lower the correlation threshold and
  alternative optima start appearing as targets. If a reaction's flux is not
  close to linear in the enforced product, its slope is not meaningful.
- **Forcing a product the model cannot make.** If the target exchange cannot
  carry flux, every step of the scan is infeasible and there is nothing to
  correlate. Check it with a single solve first.
- **Reporter metabolites on an unfiltered gene list.** The correction handles
  neighbourhood size, not a p-value distribution that is uniform because
  nothing is differentially expressed. Look at the input distribution before
  trusting the ranking.
- **Currency metabolites at the top.** ATP, NADH and water take part in a
  large share of all reactions, so they surface easily. Excluding them, or
  reading past them, is usually necessary.
