# User guide

Short, task-focused pages: one job per page, three to eight functions, in
**MATLAB and Python side by side**. Start at
[Getting started](getting-started.md) and read on, or jump to whichever task you
have in front of you.

Two older sets of material sit at the end of this section: a complete
[reconstruction protocol](../protocol/index.md) for *H. polymorpha*, followed
start to finish, and the [legacy tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) from the
original RAVEN paper. Both are MATLAB only.

!!! info "cobrapy"
    Functions that come from cobrapy rather than raven-toolbox carry a
    <span class="cobrapy-tag">cobrapy</span> badge, their import line shows where
    they live (`from cobra.io import read_sbml_model`), and the badge links to
    the cobrapy documentation. [MATLAB vs Python](../differences.md) lists every
    such function.

!!! info "Executed examples"
    Every snippet on the nineteen numbered pages is run on each commit and
    checked against the output shown beneath it, in both languages. Two pages
    cannot be: [10. Context-specific models](init.md), whose steps take hours on
    Human-GEM, and [19. Reconstruction from KEGG](kegg.md), which downloads
    tens of megabytes and takes minutes. Both say so at the top and quote the
    wall-clock of the run their numbers came from.

    That guarantee covers the numbered pages only. The protocol and the legacy
    tutorials at the end of this section are MATLAB-only and are not executed.

## Example data

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`smallYeast.yml`](../data/smallYeast.yml) | central carbon metabolism in yeast; the default example |
| [`smallYeastBad.yml`](../data/smallYeastBad.yml) | the same model with deliberate errors, for the curation pages |
| [`empty.xml`](../data/empty.xml) | an empty model with compartments, for building one from scratch |
| [`yeast-GEM.yml`](../data/yeast-GEM.yml) | yeast-GEM v9.1.0, the consensus *S. cerevisiae* model, for pages that need a genome-scale one |
| [`yeast-GEM.xml`](../data/yeast-GEM.xml) | the same model as SBML |
| [`anaerobic.yml`](../data/anaerobic.yml) | a condition file: yeast-GEM under anaerobic conditions |

## Pages

**Foundations**

1. [Getting started](getting-started.md) — load a model and inspect it.
2. [Model structure and identifiers](model-structure.md) — how the RAVEN struct
   and `cobra.Model` correspond, field by field.
3. [Reading and writing models](io.md) — SBML, RAVEN YAML, Excel, text, and the
   layout a model repository expects.

**Simulation**

4. [Simulating growth with FBA](fba.md) — objective, bounds, solve, read the
   fluxes.
5. [Growth media and conditions](media.md) — define a medium, keep a condition as
   data.
6. [Solvers and configuration](solvers.md) — which solver, and how to read what
   it returns.

**Building and curating**

7. [Building a model from scratch](building.md) — metabolites, reactions, genes,
   exchanges.
8. [Editing an existing model](editing.md) — stoichiometry, GPRs, bounds,
   deletions.
9. [Quality control](quality-control.md) — structure, mass balance, blocked
   reactions, mass from nothing.

**Reconstruction**

10. [Context-specific models (tINIT / ftINIT)](init.md) — extracting a cell-line
    model from Human-GEM and RNA-seq, end to end.

**Analysis and repair**

11. [Deletions and essentiality](deletions.md) — knockouts, essential genes and
    reactions, MOMA.
12. [Metabolic tasks](tasks.md) — saying what a model must be able to do, and
    checking that it still can.
13. [Gap-filling](gap-filling.md) — closing the holes a draft model has.
14. [Flux variability](fva.md) — how much each flux can still move, and
    which predictions the model has no choice about.
15. [Random sampling](sampling.md) — the distribution behind those ranges, and
    how to condition it on a state worth asking about.
16. [Combining and simplifying models](combining.md) — merging models on
    metabolite names, and taking one apart again.
17. [Comparing models](comparing.md) — what changed between two models, and how
    much that difference costs.
18. [Reconstruction from homology](homology.md) — BLAST a proteome against a
    template model's genes, and what the cut-offs decide for you.
19. [Reconstruction from KEGG](kegg.md) — a draft with no template model at all,
    and what such a draft is missing.

## Also in this section

| | |
|---|---|
| [Worked protocol — *H. polymorpha*](../protocol/index.md) | homology-based reconstruction of `hanpo-GEM`, end to end, from template models to a growing methylotrophic draft. A published pipeline followed from start to finish. MATLAB only, not executed here. |
| [Legacy tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) | five exercises from the original RAVEN paper (Agren et al., 2013), updated to run with current RAVEN but otherwise unchanged. MATLAB only. |

Use the numbered pages to look something up; use the protocol to see a whole
reconstruction in order.

**Planned** — phenotype exploration,
engineering targets; biomass composition and annotation; omics integration;
localization; FSEOF and reporter metabolites; table-driven curation.
