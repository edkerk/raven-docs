# 11. Deletions and essentiality

Which genes can the organism lose and still grow? Knock each one out, re-solve,
and compare. The same machinery answers "which reactions are essential", "what
happens if I delete two things at once", and "how do I predict a knockout's flux
distribution better than plain FBA does".

### Functions on this page

## Setup

`smallYeast.yml`, with glucose and oxygen open so the model grows. Uptake in
this model is a **positive** flux through a `=> metabolite` reaction, so it is
the upper bound that opens it.

## 11.1 Knock out one gene

The question underneath every deletion study: with this gene gone, can the model
still reach its objective? A gene knockout is not a reaction knockout: the GPR
decides. Remove one of two isozymes and nothing happens; remove a subunit of a
complex and the reaction goes.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
modelKO = removeGenes(model, {'YBR196C'}, 'removeBlockedRxns', true);
solKO = solveLP(modelKO);
fprintf('PGI1 knockout: %.4f /h\n', solKO.f);
```

```text
PGI1 knockout: -0.0000 /h
```
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from cobra.manipulation import knock_out_model_genes

with model:
    knock_out_model_genes(model, ["YBR196C"])
    print(f"PGI1 knockout: {model.slim_optimize():.4f} /h")

print(f"wild type again: {model.slim_optimize():.4f} /h")
```

```text
PGI1 knockout: 0.0000 /h
wild type again: 0.1222 /h
```

`knock_out_model_genes` sets the bounds of every reaction whose GPR is no
longer satisfiable to zero, and leaves the rest alone. Inside `with model:`
it is undone on the way out, so the knockout does not persist past the
block.

## 11.2 Knock out every gene

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
[genes, fluxes] = findGeneDeletions(model, 'testType', 'sgd');
growth = full(fluxes(logical(model.c), :));   % fluxes come back sparse
fprintf('%d genes tested, %d essential\n', numel(genes), sum(growth < 1e-6));
```

```text
61 genes tested, 9 essential
```

`fluxes` comes back sparse and with one column per deletion, so the growth
row has to be pulled out by the objective's position, as above.
`findGeneDeletions` also returns a `details` vector saying what happened to
each gene: whether it was deleted, proved lethal, or was skipped because it
only appears on dead-end reactions and deleting it could not change the
answer.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from cobra.flux_analysis import single_gene_deletion

results = single_gene_deletion(model)
essential = results[results.growth < 1e-6]
print(f"{len(results)} genes tested, {len(essential)} essential")
print(sorted(next(iter(ids)) for ids in essential.ids)[:5])
```

```text
61 genes tested, 9 essential
['YBR196C', 'YCR012W', 'YDL066W', 'YDR050C', 'YKL060C']
```

`single_gene_deletion` returns a DataFrame indexed by the deleted gene set,
with the resulting growth rate and solver status, so ordinary pandas
filtering finds the essential ones. The index holds a frozenset per row,
because the same function shape serves the double-deletion case.

## 11.3 Essential reactions

Reaction essentiality asks the same question one level down. The two functions
below look equivalent but ask different questions, which is why their answers
differ by 24.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
essential = getEssentialRxns(model);
fprintf('%d essential reactions\n', numel(essential));
```

```text
0 essential reactions
```

`getEssentialRxns` zeroes the objective before it starts and calls a
reaction essential when constraining it to zero makes the problem
**infeasible**. It is asking what the model needs in order to have any
solution at all, not what it needs in order to grow. With the medium open,
nothing in `smallYeast.yml` is required for feasibility, so the answer is
zero. `ignoreRxns` excludes reactions from the search.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from cobra.flux_analysis import single_reaction_deletion

results = single_reaction_deletion(model)
essential = results[results.growth < 1e-6]
print(f"{len(essential)} essential reactions")
```

```text
24 essential reactions
```

`single_reaction_deletion` keeps the objective and counts the reactions
whose removal drops growth below the threshold applied afterwards, `1e-6`
here. That is essentiality with respect to growth, which is the question
most deletion studies mean, and it is why this returns 24 where the MATLAB
tab returns none.

For essentiality with respect to a *task* rather than the objective,
raven-toolbox has `find_task_essential_reactions`; see
[12. Metabolic tasks](tasks.md).

## 11.4 Two at a time

Double deletions find the redundancy single deletions miss: two genes that each
look dispensable but cannot both be deleted. The number of pairs to test is
quadratic in the number of genes, so run time grows sharply with model size.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
[genes, fluxes] = findGeneDeletions(model, 'testType', 'dgd');
fprintf('%d gene pairs tested\n', size(genes, 1));
```

```text
1830 gene pairs tested
```
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from cobra.flux_analysis import double_gene_deletion

subset = [gene for gene in model.genes][:8]
pairs = double_gene_deletion(model, gene_list1=subset)
print(f"{len(pairs)} combinations tested")
print(f"lowest growth: {pairs.growth.min():.4f} /h")
```

```text
36 combinations tested
lowest growth: 0.0000 /h
```

## 11.5 A knockout's fluxes, not just its growth rate

FBA assumes the knockout re-optimises perfectly, which a cell that just lost a
gene does not do. MOMA instead looks for the flux distribution closest to the
wild type that the mutant can actually achieve, usually a better predictor of a
knockout's physiology, and a different answer.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

**RAVEN has no MOMA.** It had `qMOMA`, which solved the quadratic problem
with `quadprog` from MATLAB's **Optimization Toolbox**; RAVEN 3 removed it
as the last function that depended on a paid MATLAB toolbox. Nothing in
RAVEN replaces it, so a MOMA prediction has to come from the Python side,
or from the COBRA Toolbox, which keeps its own.

What RAVEN does offer for the same *question* (what changed in the mutant,
rather than by how much growth fell) is `compareFluxes` on two flux
vectors from the same model, in [17. Comparing models](comparing.md).

:::{warning} What can go wrong
- **Confusing gene and reaction knockouts.** Deleting a gene only silences a
  reaction when the GPR says so. Isozymes mask single knockouts, which is
  what the double deletions test.
- **Comparing essentiality numbers from the two toolboxes.**
  `getEssentialRxns` measures feasibility and `single_reaction_deletion`
  measures growth; they are not two implementations of one question.
- **A knockout that looks lethal because the medium is wrong.** Essentiality
  is relative to the medium and the objective. State both when you report it;
  see [5. Growth media and conditions](media.md).
- **Reading essentiality off a threshold.** `growth < 1e-6` is a numerical
  cut-off, not biology. A mutant at 1 % of wild-type growth is not dead.
- **Double deletions on a genome-scale model.** Quadratic in the gene count;
  restrict the lists, or accept the wait.
