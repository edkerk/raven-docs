# 16. Combining and simplifying models

Two operations that look like bookkeeping and are not. **Merging** puts models
together: a draft and a template, two organisms, a curated core and an
extension, and the result is only as sound as the assumption that a metabolite
in one model is the same molecule as in the other. **Simplifying** takes a model
apart again, dropping what cannot carry flux, and the risk is deleting something
you needed.

## Setup

`smallYeast.yml`, and a second model to merge it with. Taking a copy and giving
it a new id keeps the example honest: whatever the merge does to two identical
models is the clearest possible statement of what it matches on.

::::

Read those numbers carefully. The reactions **doubled** and the metabolites did
**not**: two models that describe the same 52 metabolites end up sharing them,
while every reaction is carried over from both sources and kept.

That asymmetry is the whole behaviour. Metabolites are matched on
**name and compartment** (`metaboliteName[comp]`, not the identifier) and
genes on name, so anything the two models call by the same name becomes one
entity. Reactions are matched on nothing: every one is carried over, and the
warning is RAVEN saying so. An id that already exists gets the source model's
id appended (`HXK` and `HXK_second`), which keeps the identifiers unique
without pretending the two reactions were reconciled. Python renames the same
way, without a warning.

`mergeModels` takes `metParam` to choose what metabolites are matched on:
`"metNames"`, the default used above, or `"mets"` to match on identifier.
Matching on id is the right choice when both models come from the same
database, where the ids mean the same thing and the names may not.

:::{warning} Names, not identifiers
Two models built from different databases usually share almost no metabolite
**names** either, in which case merging produces a model with two disconnected
halves that happen to live in the same struct. Merging is a claim that the
naming is consistent; check it before you make it, not after.
:::

## 16.2 Merging does not de-duplicate

Every reaction from both models survived, so the merged model now describes each
conversion twice. Collapsing those is a separate step.

contracted = contractModel(merged);

:::
::::

`simplifyModel` does nothing much unless told what to remove: every flag is off
by default except `deleteUnconstrained`. `deleteMinMax` is the expensive one
used above, minimising and maximising each reaction to find out whether it can
carry flux; `deleteInaccessible` drops dead ends structurally,
`deleteZeroInterval` drops reactions already pinned to zero, and
`deleteDuplicates` does what `contractModel` does. `reservedRxns` protects
reactions from all of them. On the Python side the same choices are
`delete_no_flux` and its siblings, with `open_exchanges` deciding whether the
test runs on the medium as it stands or with the boundary opened first.

:::{warning} Which functions mutate
Every RAVEN function here returns a new model struct and leaves its input
alone. The Python side is not uniform:

| Python | |
|---|---|
| `remove_duplicate_reactions`, `simplify_model` | change the model **in place**, return `None` |
| `merge_models`, `merge_compartments` | return a **new** model |

`model = simplify_model(model)` is correct MATLAB and sets `model` to `None`
in Python. Copy the model first to keep the original.

## 16.3 Dropping what cannot carry flux

`smallYeast` ships with its medium shut, so almost nothing in it can carry flux
at all, the state [9. Quality control](quality-control.md) measures. That makes
it a good subject for simplification, and a good warning about it.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
shut = readYAMLmodel('smallYeast.yml');
fprintf('%d of %d reactions can carry flux\n', ...
    sum(haveFlux(shut)), numel(shut.rxns));
reduced = simplifyModel(shut, 'deleteMinMax', true);   % test each reaction by LP
fprintf('simplified: %d rxns, %d mets\n', numel(reduced.rxns), numel(reduced.mets));
```

```text
2 of 53 reactions can carry flux
simplified: 2 rxns, 4 mets
```
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from raven_toolbox.manipulation import simplify_model

shut = read_yaml_model("smallYeast.yml")
reduced = shut.copy()
simplify_model(reduced, delete_no_flux=True, open_exchanges=False)
print(f"simplified: {len(reduced.reactions)} rxns, "
      f"{len(reduced.metabolites)} mets")
```

```text
simplified: 2 rxns, 4 mets
```
:::
::::

A model that has been simplified against a shut medium is a model of that
medium, not of the organism. Open the conditions you intend to simulate
**before** simplifying, or you will delete the pathways you were about to study;
see [5. Growth media and conditions](media.md).

## 16.4 Collapsing compartments

Sometimes the compartments are the problem: a draft with unreliable
localisation, or a comparison against a model that has none.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
[flat, deletedRxns] = mergeCompartments(model);
fprintf('%d compartments -> %d, %d -> %d mets, %d -> %d rxns\n', ...
    numel(model.comps), numel(flat.comps), ...
    numel(model.mets), numel(flat.mets), numel(model.rxns), numel(flat.rxns));
fprintf('%d transport reactions dropped\n', numel(deletedRxns));
```

```text
2 compartments -> 1, 52 -> 45 mets, 53 -> 50 rxns
0 transport reactions dropped
```
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from raven_toolbox.manipulation import merge_compartments

flat, dropped, _ = merge_compartments(model)
print(f"{len(model.compartments)} compartments -> {len(flat.compartments)}, "
      f"{len(model.metabolites)} -> {len(flat.metabolites)} mets, "
      f"{len(model.reactions)} -> {len(flat.reactions)} rxns")
print(f"{len(dropped)} transport reactions dropped")
```

```text
2 compartments -> 1, 52 -> 45 mets, 53 -> 50 rxns
3 transport reactions dropped
```
:::
::::

Seven metabolites in this model exist in both compartments, so 52 collapse to
45; the three reactions that merely moved something across the mitochondrial
membrane become `A -> A`, carry no information, and are dropped.

:::{note} The two count the removals differently
Both toolboxes end at 50 reactions, but the second line disagrees: RAVEN
reports **0** dropped where raven-toolbox reports **3** (`CAT2`, `CO2TRANS`,
`ShuttleX`). The same three reactions go in both cases. RAVEN clears them
when it removes reactions the merge left empty, and its `deletedRxns` counts
only what the `deleteRxnsWithOneMet` path deleted, which is nothing, since
that flag is `false` by default.

A reaction left holding a single metabolite after merging carries no
information and should go; an **exchange** had a single metabolite all along
(`=> glucose`) and must be kept. raven-toolbox used to delete those too,
along with the objective, taking this model from growth `0.1222` to `0.0000`
with no error and no warning. Fixed in
[raven-toolbox#96](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox/pull/96);
if a flattened model comes back with no boundary reactions, update
raven-toolbox.
:::

That is a real loss. A model that distinguishes mitochondrial from cytosolic
acetyl-CoA cannot be recovered from the flattened one, and the flattened model
permits a pathway to run on a pool that no membrane separates.
Flatten a copy, for a specific question, and keep the original.

:::{warning} What can go wrong
- **Merging on inconsistent names.** The match is on name and compartment.
  Different naming conventions give you two disconnected networks in one
  model, and nothing warns you loudly.
- **Expecting de-duplication.** Merging keeps every reaction from every
  source. Contract afterwards, and check what got collapsed.
- **Simplifying against the wrong condition.** Reactions are removed because
  they cannot carry flux *under the current bounds*. Change the medium first.
- **In place or a copy.** The Python functions mutate; the MATLAB ones
  return. Mixing the conventions loses either the original or the result.
- **`deleteUnconstrained` has no Python counterpart.** RAVEN models mark
  boundary metabolites with an `unconstrained` field; cobra models use
  explicit boundary reactions instead, so that flag has nothing to act on.
