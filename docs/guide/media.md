# 5. Growth media and conditions

An FBA result is a statement about a medium. This page is about setting that
medium deliberately: which exchange reactions are open, how wide, and how to keep
a condition as reviewable data instead of a paragraph of bound-setting code.

### Functions on this page

| MATLAB | Python | |
|---|---|---|
| `getExchangeRxns` | `Model.exchanges` {bdg-secondary}`cobrapy` | find the exchange reactions |
| `setExchangeBounds` | `Model.medium` {bdg-secondary}`cobrapy` | set a whole medium, closing the rest |
| `setParam` | `set_reaction_bounds` | set one reaction's bounds |
| `getMinimalMedium` | `minimal_medium` {bdg-secondary}`cobrapy` | the smallest medium that still supports growth |
| `applyCondition` | `apply_condition`, `load_condition` | apply a condition file |

## Setup

`yeast-GEM.yml` from [`docs/data/`](../data/README.md), which ships with an
aerobic minimal glucose medium already applied.

## 5.1 What is currently open

An exchange reaction connects a boundary metabolite to nothing, so its flux is
the rate at which that metabolite enters (negative) or leaves (positive) the
system. The medium is exactly the set of exchanges with a negative lower bound.

`getExchangeRxns` identifies an exchange by its stoichiometry, as a reaction
with no substrates or no products, so it does not depend on a naming
convention. Its `reactionType` argument can filter by bounds instead of
returning all of them: `'uptake'`, `'excrete'`, `'reverse'` and `'blocked'`
classify a reaction by what its bounds permit, while `'in'` and `'out'`
classify by which side the boundary metabolite sits on and ignore the bounds
entirely.

The filter above is written by hand rather than as `'uptake'` because the two
ask different questions. `'uptake'` returns reactions that can *only* take
up; every open exchange in yeast-GEM also has an upper bound of 1000, so it
can secrete as well and is classified `'reverse'`. Selecting on
`model.lb < 0` is what "the medium" means here.

`model.medium` is a dict of `{exchange id: maximum uptake rate}`, given as a
**positive** number; cobrapy flips the sign for you, so a medium entry of
`1.0` means a lower bound of `-1.0`. It lists only the exchanges that are
open, which is why the loop above prints 16 rows out of 270 reactions.
:::
::::

:::{note} 270 or 273?
The two toolboxes count exchange reactions differently, and both are right.
cobrapy sorts single-metabolite reactions into `exchanges`, `demands` and
`sinks`; `getExchangeRxns` returns all of them together. In yeast-GEM the
difference is three reactions: `r_2111` (growth) and the sinks `r_4062` and
`r_4064`, so MATLAB reports 273 where `model.exchanges` reports 270.

sol = solveLP(model);

fprintf('[%g %g] -> %.4f /h\n', model.lb(idx), model.ub(idx), sol.f);
```

```text
[-10 1000] -> 0.8370 /h
```

`setParam` takes a reaction id, a list of ids, or indices, and applies one
value to all of them or one value each. `'lb'`, `'ub'` and `'eq'` set bounds;
`'obj'` sets the objective coefficient.
:::

```python
from raven_toolbox.conditions import set_reaction_bounds

glucose = model.reactions.get_by_id("r_1714")
set_reaction_bounds(glucose, -10.0, 1000.0)
print(glucose.bounds, "->", f"{model.slim_optimize():.4f} /h")
```

```text
(-10.0, 1000.0) -> 0.8370 /h
```

`reaction.bounds = (-10.0, 1000.0)` does the same thing for ordinary edits.
`set_reaction_bounds` exists for the case cobrapy refuses: it writes the
underlying attributes directly, so a condition can land on `lb > ub`, which
cobrapy's own setter rejects as invalid. Conditions use that to force flux
through a reaction with a sentinel bound.

`slim_optimize` returns the objective value alone, without building a full
`Solution`, which is the cheaper call inside a loop over many bound
settings.

::::

## 5.3 Define a whole medium

Assigning to the medium is **not** a patch: everything not in the dict is closed.
That makes it the right tool for "this exact recipe and nothing else", and the
wrong one for "the shipped medium, but with more glucose".

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
% every uptake closed
[~, exchIdx] = getExchangeRxns(model);
modelClosed = setParam(model, 'lb', model.rxns(exchIdx), 0);
sol = solveLP(modelClosed);
fprintf('growth with nothing to eat: %.4f /h\n', sol.f);

% the shipped recipe, with more glucose
model = setParam(model, 'lb', 'r_1714', -10);
sol = solveLP(model);
fprintf('complete medium:           %.4f /h\n', sol.f);
```

```text
growth with nothing to eat:  /h
complete medium:           0.8370 /h
```

The first line prints no number at all. With every uptake closed the LP is
infeasible, and `solveLP` returns `sol.f` as an empty array with `sol.stat`
set to `-1`; `fprintf` prints nothing for an empty argument. Check `sol.stat`
rather than the value, as in [4. Simulating growth with FBA](fba.md).

`setExchangeBounds` is the closer counterpart to assigning `model.medium`. It
takes **metabolites** rather than reaction ids, sets their exchange bounds,
and with its default `closeOthers` shuts every other uptake, which is the
replace-the-whole-recipe behaviour. `mediaOnly` restricts it to the
extracellular compartment, so intracellular sink reactions are left alone.
:::

    model.medium = {}                             # every uptake closed

with model:
    model.medium = {"r_1714": 10.0, "r_1992": 1000.0}   # only glucose and oxygen
    print(f"glucose and oxygen alone:  {model.slim_optimize():.4f} /h")

model.medium = {**shipped, "r_1714": 10.0}        # the shipped recipe, more glucose
print(f"complete medium:           {model.slim_optimize():.4f} /h")
```

```text
growth with nothing to eat: nan /h
glucose and oxygen alone:  0.0000 /h
complete medium:           0.8370 /h
```

Glucose and oxygen alone are not enough; yeast-GEM also needs nitrogen,
phosphate, sulphate and a handful of ions, which is why building a medium from
`dict(model.medium)` and editing individual entries leaves the rest of the
recipe intact, where writing it out in full does not.

The three results are three different states. `nan` means the LP had no
solution; `0.0000` means it solved and the optimum is zero; `0.8370` means it
solved and the model grows. `slim_optimize` returns `nan` for the first case
rather than raising, so check `model.optimize().status` when a number is
unexpected.

## 5.4 Anaerobic growth, and why a condition is more than bounds

Switching yeast-GEM to anaerobic conditions is not just "close the oxygen
exchange". Without oxygen the model cannot make sterols or unsaturated fatty
acids, so those have to be supplied; heme a leaves the cofactor pseudoreaction;
the biomass gains an FADH2 term; and two reactions that are repressed on glucose
are blocked. Those edits belong together, so both toolboxes read them from one
YAML file (a *condition*), which can be reviewed as data rather than buried in a
script.

[`anaerobic.yml`](../data/anaerobic.yml) is that file, transcribed from
yeast-GEM's own `anaerobicModel.m`:

```yaml title="anaerobic.yml (abridged)"
cofactor_pseudoreaction:
  rxn_id: r_4598
  remove_mets:
    - { met: s_3714 }        # heme a
  charge_balance_met: s_0794 # H+

biomass_stoichiometry_delta:
  rxn_id: r_4041             # biomass pseudoreaction
  add:
    - { met: s_0689, coef:  0.08 }   # FADH2
    - { met: s_0687, coef: -0.08 }   # FAD
    - { met: s_0794, coef: -0.16 }   # H+

bounds:
  - { rxn: r_1992, lb: 0 }         # no oxygen
  - { rxn: r_1757, lb: -1000 }     # ergosterol, supplied
  - { rxn: r_2189, lb: -1000 }     # oleate, supplied
  - { rxn: r_1967, lb: -1000 }     # nicotinate
  - { rxn: r_0714, lb: 0, ub: 0 }  # MDH2, repressed on glucose
```

The schema is narrow on purpose: an optional `prelude` that resets the exchanges,
an optional cofactor-pseudoreaction edit, an optional biomass-stoichiometry
delta, a list of per-reaction `bounds`, and an `expected_uptake_count` that fails
loudly when the condition no longer matches the model.

Removing a metabolite from the cofactor pseudoreaction leaves it charge
imbalanced, so `charge_balance_met` names the metabolite whose coefficient
absorbs the difference. Both toolboxes recompute it rather than storing the new
value, so the file stays readable as a statement of intent.

::::{tab-set}

<!-- run-examples: skip -->

```matlab
modelAnaerobic = applyCondition(model, 'anaerobic.yml');
sol = solveLP(modelAnaerobic);
fprintf('anaerobic growth: %.4f /h\n', sol.f);
```

`applyCondition` reads the file with `parseYAML`, which goes through
MATLAB's Python bridge, so it needs a linked CPython with `pyyaml`
installed (`pyenv` in MATLAB shows which interpreter is linked). That is
also why this block carries no output here: the documentation build has
no linked interpreter.
:::

```python
from raven_toolbox.conditions import apply_condition, load_condition

condition = load_condition("anaerobic.yml")
print("bounds changed:", len(condition["bounds"]))

anaerobic = apply_condition(model.copy(), condition)
print(f"anaerobic growth: {anaerobic.slim_optimize():.4f} /h")
```

```text
bounds changed: 12
anaerobic growth: 0.1615 /h
```

`apply_condition` edits the model **in place** and returns it, so pass a copy
to keep the aerobic model as well. It also takes the path directly:
`apply_condition(model, "anaerobic.yml")`. `load_condition` is the parse step
on its own, for inspecting or editing a condition before applying it.

Compare 0.1615 /h against the 0.8370 /h the same model reached aerobically
in 5.3: both are on 10 mmol glucose, because the condition is applied to the
model as 5.3 left it. Fermentation yields far less ATP per glucose than
respiration, and the ratio is the point of the comparison.
:::

## 5.5 What is the model actually living on?

A medium copied from a paper usually contains more than the model needs.
`getMinimalMedium` and cobrapy's `minimal_medium` search for the smallest set of
uptakes that still supports a given growth rate, which identifies which component
is necessary for growth, and catches a nutrient the model does not need because a
gap-filled reaction produces it internally.

==============================================================
```

Candidates are the exchanges that already have `lb < 0`; a nutrient the model
cannot take up in the first place is never proposed. `minGrowth` defaults to
10% of the unconstrained optimum, which is loose enough that most components
drop out, so state it explicitly, as here, when the question is about a
particular growth rate. `verbose` set to `false` suppresses the table and
returns the ids alone.

Of the 16 open uptakes, 14 are kept: water and H+ are dropped because other
reactions supply them. `getMinimalMedium` solves a **MILP**, minimising the
number of open uptakes, which the GLPK that ships with RAVEN cannot do: with
GLPK selected it reports `glpk is not suitable for solving MILPs`. cobrapy's
`minimal_medium` defaults to an LP relaxation that minimises total uptake
flux instead, which is why the Python tab runs on any solver and returns
rates rather than a list.

The values are uptake rates, not bounds, and the zeros are components the
solution needs at a rate below the printed precision rather than not at all.
Passing `minimize_components=True` switches to the MILP formulation and
returns the same kind of answer `getMinimalMedium` gives.

::::

:::{warning} What can go wrong
- **`infeasible` right after setting a medium.** Something essential is
  closed. Reopen the medium one component at a time, or start from
  `minimal_medium` on the working model and compare.
- **The sign convention bites.** Uptake is a *negative* flux, but
  `model.medium` takes *positive* numbers. Both are right; mixing them is not.
- **The model grows without a carbon source.** Usually a leak: some reaction
  produces carbon from nothing. [9. Quality control](quality-control.md) is
  where that gets diagnosed, with `canExchange` and `analyse_topology`.
- **Results that cannot be reproduced.** If a medium is defined inside a
  script, the next person runs a different one. A condition file is data,
  and it diffs.
