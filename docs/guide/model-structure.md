# 2. Model structure and identifiers

The same model is a **struct of parallel arrays** in MATLAB and a **graph of
objects** in Python. Knowing which field corresponds to which attribute is most
of what you need to translate a script between the two.

### Functions on this page

| MATLAB | Python | |
|---|---|---|
| `checkModelStruct` | `check_model` | report problems in a model |
| `sortIdentifiers` | `sort_identifiers` | sort reactions, metabolites and genes by id |
| `getIndexes` | `parse_name_comp` | split a `name[comp]` token |
| no equivalent | `subsystem_to_str` | one subsystem string, whatever the source stored |
| `addIdentifierPrefix`, `removeIdentifierPrefix` | handled on read/write <span class="cobrapy-tag">cobrapy</span> | SBML identifier prefixes |
| `ravenCobraWrapper` | not needed | convert between RAVEN and COBRA structs |

## The correspondence

| RAVEN field | cobrapy | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `model.rxns` | `model.reactions` (ids) | a `DictList`, indexable by id or position |
| `model.rxnNames` | `reaction.name` | |
| `model.mets`, `model.metNames` | `model.metabolites`, `metabolite.name` | |
| `model.metFormulas` | `metabolite.formula` | |
| `model.genes` | `model.genes` | |
| `model.grRules` | `reaction.gene_reaction_rule` | same Boolean syntax |
| `model.rxnGeneMat` | `reaction.genes`, `gene.reactions` | the mapping is navigable from either side |
| `model.lb`, `model.ub` | `reaction.bounds` | |
| `model.rev` | derived from the bounds | `reaction.reversibility` is read-only |
| `model.S` | `create_stoichiometric_matrix(model)` | built on demand, not stored |
| `model.comps`, `model.metComps` | `metabolite.compartment`, `model.compartments` | |
| `model.subSystems` | `reaction.subsystem` | RAVEN allows several per reaction |
| `model.c` | `model.objective` | an expression, not a coefficient vector |

The consequence: in MATLAB the caller keeps **parallel arrays aligned**, and in
Python the **objects hold their own references**. Deleting a reaction in RAVEN means removing the same row from every
reaction-length field, and the matching column of `model.S`, which is why
`removeReactions` exists rather than a one-line deletion. In cobrapy the object
holds its own links, so `model.remove_reactions([...])` is enough and there is no
state left behind to go stale.

That difference also decides where mistakes surface. A RAVEN model can be left in
a state no function rejects but later functions misread, which is why RAVEN ships
a validator (2.4). A `cobra.Model` cannot reach most of those states at all,
because the structure is maintained by the class rather than by the caller.

## Setup

`smallYeast.yml` from [`docs/data/`](../data/README.md).

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    model = readYAMLmodel('smallYeast.yml');
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.io import read_yaml_model

    model = read_yaml_model("smallYeast.yml")
    ```

## 2.1 The same lookup, two ways

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    idx = getIndexes(model, 'PGI', 'rxns');
    fprintf('%s: %s\n', model.rxns{idx}, model.rxnNames{idx});
    fprintf('genes: %s\n', model.grRules{idx});
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    PGI: Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
    genes: YBR196C
    ```

    Most RAVEN functions take or return indices rather than identifiers, and
    `getIndexes` converts between the two. The third argument
    names the field to search, because the same string can be a reaction id in
    one field and nothing at all in another. It takes `'rxns'`, `'mets'`,
    `'genes'`, `'metnames'` or `'metcomps'`, plus `'ecrxns'`, `'ecenzymes'` and
    `'ecgenes'` on a GECKO model that carries a `model.ec` structure.

    A miss is an error rather than a zero: `getIndexes` raises
    `Could not find object 'X' in the model` in every mode except `'metnames'`,
    which returns an empty vector instead. That exception exists because a
    metabolite *name* can occur in several compartments, so `'metnames'` returns
    every matching index rather than one. Asking for several names at once gives
    back a cell array with one index vector per name; asking for exactly one name
    unwraps that to a plain vector.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    rxn = model.reactions.get_by_id("PGI")
    print(f"{rxn.id}: {rxn.name}")
    print("genes:", rxn.gene_reaction_rule)
    print("also reachable as:", model.reactions.PGI.id)
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    PGI: Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
    genes: YBR196C
    also reachable as: PGI
    ```

    There is no index to carry around: `DictList` looks up by id, and the object
    is the handle. `get_by_id` raises `KeyError` on a miss. The attribute form
    `model.reactions.PGI` is the same lookup, and works only for ids that happen
    to be valid Python names, so `model.reactions.r_0001` resolves but an id
    containing a dot or a hyphen has to go through `get_by_id`. Both forms return
    the same object, and keeping a reference to it stays valid across edits
    elsewhere in the model.

## 2.2 Compartments

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    disp(model.comps);                       % compartment ids
    i = getIndexes(model, 'G6P_c', 'mets');
    disp(model.comps{model.metComps(i)});    % the compartment of one metabolite
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
        {'c'}
        {'m'}

    c
    ```

    `model.metComps` holds an index into `model.comps` rather than the
    compartment letter, so reading a metabolite's compartment always takes the
    two steps above. The indirection keeps compartment names editable in one
    place: renaming a compartment is a single edit to `model.compNames`, with
    nothing to update per metabolite.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    print(model.compartments)
    print(model.metabolites.get_by_id("G6P_c").compartment)
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    {'m': 'mitochondria', 'c': 'cytosol'}
    c
    ```

    `model.compartments` maps id to name and is derived from the metabolites, so
    a compartment exists exactly as long as something is in it.

RAVEN also writes metabolite names as `name[comp]` in Excel and text exports, and
accepts that form on input. Both toolboxes split the token on the **last**
bracketed group, so a name that itself contains brackets still resolves.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    % 'metcomps' resolves the name[comp] form; 'metnames' matches names alone
    i = getIndexes(model, 'alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate[c]', 'metcomps');
    fprintf('%d %s\n', i, model.mets{i});
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    14 G6P_c
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.utils.parse import parse_name_comp

    print(parse_name_comp("alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate[c]"))
    print(parse_name_comp("ATP"))
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    ('alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate', 'c')
    ('ATP', None)
    ```

    `parse_name_comp` returns the compartment as `None` when there is no trailing
    bracket, so one call handles both forms and the caller decides what a missing
    compartment means. Note the import path: it lives in
    `raven_toolbox.utils.parse`, not in the `raven_toolbox.utils` package
    namespace, which re-exports only the curation helpers.

## 2.3 Subsystems

RAVEN lets a reaction belong to several subsystems, so an entry of
`model.subSystems` is either a single string or a cell array of them. The field
as a whole has to pick one of the two shapes; mixing them is what 2.4 catches.
cobrapy stores one string per reaction, and `subsystem_to_str` normalises
whichever form a model arrived with.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    % nest every entry before nesting one, so the field keeps a single shape
    model.subSystems = cellfun(@cellstr, model.subSystems, 'UniformOutput', false);
    model.subSystems{idx} = {'Glycolysis', 'Pentose phosphate pathway'};
    fprintf('%s\n', strjoin(model.subSystems{idx}, '; '));
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    Glycolysis; Pentose phosphate pathway
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.utils.parse import subsystem_to_str

    rxn.subsystem = ["Glycolysis", "Pentose phosphate pathway"]
    print(subsystem_to_str(rxn.subsystem))
    print(subsystem_to_str("Glycolysis"))
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    Glycolysis;Pentose phosphate pathway
    Glycolysis
    ```

    cobrapy declares `Reaction.subsystem` a plain string but does not enforce it,
    so a model that came through RAVEN, or through hand-written YAML, can hold a
    list there and nothing complains until something tries to concatenate it.
    `subsystem_to_str` joins the parts with `;` instead of taking the first, so no
    name is silently dropped, and returns `""` for an empty or absent subsystem.
    Use it wherever a subsystem is printed, compared or written out.

## 2.4 Check the model

Both toolboxes provide a validator, and they check different things, because the
two representations fail in different ways.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    issues = checkModelStruct(model, 'throwErrors', false);
    fprintf('%d issue(s)\n', numel(issues));

    mixed = model;
    mixed.subSystems{idx} = 'Glycolysis';   % a plain string among cell arrays
    issues = checkModelStruct(mixed, 'throwErrors', false);
    fprintf('%d issue(s), category %s\n', numel(issues), issues(1).category);
    fprintf('%s\n', issues(1).message);
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    0 issue(s)
    1 issue(s), category wrong_type
    The "subSystems" field must be a cell array of chars, *or* a cell array of cell arrays of chars
    ```

    `checkModelStruct` validates the struct itself: that required fields are
    present, that each holds the type and length it should, and that identifiers
    are non-empty, unique and legal. On top of that it reports advisory findings:
    metabolites and genes nothing uses, bounds that contradict each other, a
    missing or ambiguous objective, malformed gene rules and formulas, and
    cross-references that point nowhere. Every finding carries a `category`
    (`missing_field`, `wrong_type`, `empty_id`, `duplicate`, `invalid_id`,
    `invalid_bounds`, `unused`, `objective`, `gpr`, `invalid_formula`,
    `cross_reference` or `other`), a `target` naming the field or identifier
    involved, and the full `message`.

    Asking for an output argument, as above, returns the findings and neither
    prints nor throws. Called without one it reports as it goes, and
    `throwErrors` decides whether a structural problem stops the script; advisory
    findings are warnings either way.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.utils import check_model

    issues = check_model(model)
    print(len(issues), "issue(s)")
    for issue in issues[:5]:
        print(f"  {issue.category}: {issue.message}")
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    0 issue(s)
    ```

    `check_model` has no field types to police, because a `cobra.Model` cannot
    hold a misshapen field in the first place. What it checks instead is the
    curation layer cobrapy leaves to the caller: metabolites and genes no
    reaction uses, reactions with no metabolites, metabolites without a name, two
    metabolites sharing a name inside one compartment, and an objective that is
    missing or spread over several reactions. Each `ModelIssue` carries
    `category`, `object_id` and `message`, and the function returns a list rather
    than raising, so a script can filter by category and decide for itself what is
    fatal.

    A `0` here means no curation problem was found, not that the model would also
    satisfy `checkModelStruct`. The two lists overlap only on the unused-element
    and objective checks.

## 2.5 Sort the identifiers before you commit

Sorting makes the diff between two versions of a model readable, which is why
`exportForGit` and `export_for_git` offer it too. Without it, adding one reaction
can shift everything after it and turn a one-line change into a whole-file diff.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    sortedModel = sortIdentifiers(model);
    fprintf('%s\n', strjoin(sortedModel.rxns(1:5)', ', '));
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    ACO, ACS, ADH1, ALD6, ATPX
    ```

    `sortIdentifiers` returns a new struct and leaves the original alone. It
    permutes reactions, metabolites, genes and compartments together with every
    field indexed by them, `model.S` and `model.rxnGeneMat` included, so the model
    stays internally consistent.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.utils import sort_identifiers

    sorted_model = sort_identifiers(model)
    print([r.id for r in sorted_model.reactions[:5]])
    print("same object:", sorted_model is model)
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    ['ACO', 'ACS', 'ADH1', 'ALD6', 'ATPX']
    same object: True
    ```

    `sort_identifiers` sorts in place and returns the model it was given, so the
    name on the left is not a second copy. Pass `model.copy()` when the original
    order still matters. Compartments are a plain dict and are left alone here;
    the writers emit them in order where it counts.

!!! warning "MATLAB only: converting to and from the COBRA Toolbox"
    RAVEN and the COBRA Toolbox use different field names for the same model.
    `ravenCobraWrapper` converts a struct in either direction, inferring which
    direction from the fields it finds. There is no Python equivalent because
    there is nothing to convert: a raven-toolbox model **is** a `cobra.Model`,
    which is what every Python COBRA tool already takes.

!!! warning "What can go wrong"
    - **Fields drift out of alignment.** In MATLAB, editing one reaction-length
      field by hand without editing the others leaves a model that looks fine and
      fails later, often far from the edit. `checkModelStruct` is how you catch
      it.
    - **A field ends up with mixed contents.** `model.subSystems` takes strings
      or cell arrays of strings, but not both in the same model. Convert the whole
      field, not one entry.
    - **`model.rev` disagrees with the bounds.** RAVEN stores reversibility
      explicitly, so it can contradict `lb` and `ub` after a manual edit, and
      different functions consult different ones. Python cannot get into that
      state, because `reaction.reversibility` is computed from the bounds on every
      read.
    - **Subsystems come back as a list.** Code that assumes `reaction.subsystem`
      is a string breaks on a model imported from RAVEN. Use `subsystem_to_str`.
    - **A name lookup returns several indices.** `getIndexes` with `'metnames'`
      matches a name in every compartment it occurs in. Use `'metcomps'` and the
      `name[comp]` form when you mean one specific metabolite.
