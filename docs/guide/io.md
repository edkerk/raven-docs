# 3. Reading and writing models

Get a model in and out of both toolboxes: SBML, RAVEN YAML, Excel, and the
directory layout a Git-maintained model repository expects.

### Functions on this page

| MATLAB | Python | |
|---|---|---|
| `importModel` | `read_sbml_model` {bdg-secondary}`cobrapy` | read SBML |
| `exportModel` | `write_sbml_model` {bdg-secondary}`cobrapy` | write SBML |
| `readYAMLmodel` | `read_yaml_model` | read RAVEN YAML |
| `writeYAMLmodel` | `write_yaml_model` | write RAVEN YAML |
| `exportToExcelFormat` | `export_to_excel` | write the RAVEN Excel format |
| `exportForGit` | `export_for_git` | write a Standard-GEM repository layout |

Which of these you need depends on the file, not on the model: all of them
produce the same in-memory model, and none of them is the canonical format.
What differs is what survives a round trip and how readable the file is, which
3.2 and 3.4 show with examples.

## Setup

This page uses two models from [`docs/data/`](../data/README.md):
`smallYeast.yml` (RAVEN YAML, 45 kB) and `yeast-GEM.xml` (SBML, yeast-GEM v9.1.0).

## 3.1 Read a model

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
modelSmall = readYAMLmodel('smallYeast.yml');
modelYeast = importModel('yeast-GEM.xml');

fprintf('%s %d reactions\n', modelSmall.id, numel(modelSmall.rxns));
fprintf('%s %d reactions\n', modelYeast.id, numel(modelYeast.rxns));
```

```text
[Warning: The following fields have prefixes removed from all entries. If this is undesired, run importModel with removePrefix as false. Example: importModel('filename.xml',[],false);]
[Warning: The following MIRIAM strings are associated to more than one unique metabolite name: bigg.metabolite/ficytb5 bigg.metabolite/hdd2coa bigg.metabolite/pail_cho bigg.metabolite/pchol_cho bigg.metabolite/succ bigg.metabolite/tchola chebi/CHEBI:138108 chebi/CHEBI:17140 chebi/CHEBI:18097 ...and 23 more]
smallYeast 53 reactions
yeastGEM_v9.1.0 4102 reactions
```

Both warnings are informational and neither stops the read. The first says
`importModel` stripped the `R_`, `M_`, `G_` and `C_` prefixes SBML requires
on identifiers, which it does only when every identifier of that type
carries one; pass `removePrefix` as `false` to keep them, which is what a
comparison against the file's own ids requires. The second reports that the
model annotates several differently-named metabolites with the same database
identifier. That is a property of yeast-GEM rather than of the reader, and it
makes those annotations unusable as a key for matching metabolites across
models.

`importModel` accepts SBML Level 3 Version 1 with FBC version 2 and errors
on anything older; see the [RAVEN 3 migration guide](../raven3-migration.md#sbml-io)
if a file is rejected.

:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from cobra.io import read_sbml_model

from raven_toolbox.io import read_yaml_model

small = read_yaml_model("smallYeast.yml")
yeast = read_sbml_model("yeast-GEM.xml")

print(small.id, len(small.reactions), "reactions")
print(yeast.id, len(yeast.reactions), "reactions")
```

```text
smallYeast 53 reactions
yeastGEM_v9__46__1__46__0 4102 reactions
```

`read_sbml_model` is cobrapy's own reader and strips the same SBML prefixes.
`read_yaml_model` is raven-toolbox's, and returns a plain `cobra.Model`, so
the two are interchangeable from here on. It reads gzipped files
transparently and accepts both the current YAML layout and the older RAVEN
one, so an archived model does not need converting first.

The two ids printed above are not the same, which is 3.2.
:::
::::

## 3.2 Watch the identifier mangling

SBML identifiers must be valid XML names, so they cannot contain a dot. Model,
reaction and metabolite ids that do are encoded when the file is written, as
`__` around the character's ASCII code: a `.` becomes `__46__`. The encoding is
in the file, so what differs between the toolboxes is whether it is undone on
the way back in.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
disp(modelYeast.id);        % from yeast-GEM.xml
modelFromYaml = readYAMLmodel('yeast-GEM.yml');
disp(modelFromYaml.id);     % same release, unencoded
```

```text
yeastGEM_v9.1.0
yeastGEM_v9.1.0
```

`importModel` decodes every `__NN__` back to its character, across reactions,
metabolites, compartments, genes, gene rules and the model id, so a
round trip through SBML returns the ids you started with.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
print("from SBML:", yeast.id)

from_yaml = read_yaml_model("yeast-GEM.yml")
print("from YAML:", from_yaml.id)
print("same size:", len(from_yaml.reactions) == len(yeast.reactions))
```

```text
from SBML: yeastGEM_v9__46__1__46__0
from YAML: yeastGEM_v9.1.0
same size: True
```

cobrapy leaves the encoding in place, so the same release read from the two
formats reports two different ids while being the same model. Only the
*identifiers* are affected; `model.name` and the annotations are unchanged.
Ids have to be decoded before they can be matched against a model read from
YAML.
:::
::::

:::{note} Each toolbox is fast in one format and slow in the other
Reading yeast-GEM takes about **17 s from SBML and 73 s from YAML in
Python**, and about **78 s from SBML and 17 s from YAML in MATLAB**, so the
ranking is reversed. RAVEN parses YAML itself and goes through libSBML for
SBML; cobrapy has the opposite balance. The format therefore follows from what is
needed from it, a readable diff or the RAVEN-specific fields YAML preserves,
and a script whose run time is dominated by reading the file will often run
faster in the other format.
:::

## 3.3 Write a model

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
writeYAMLmodel(modelSmall, 'smallYeast-copy.yml');
exportModel(modelSmall, 'smallYeast.xml');

roundtrip = importModel('smallYeast.xml');
fprintf('%d %d %d\n', numel(roundtrip.rxns), numel(roundtrip.mets), ...
    numel(roundtrip.genes));
```

```text
[Warning: The following fields have one or more entries that do not start with a letter or _ (conflicting with SBML specifications). Prefixes are added to all entries in those fields:]
Document written
[Warning: The following fields have prefixes removed from all entries. If this is undesired, run importModel with removePrefix as false. Example: importModel('filename.xml',[],false);]
53 52 61
```

The two warnings are the prefixing rule in both directions: `exportModel`
adds a prefix to a whole field as soon as one id in it starts with something
other than a letter or underscore, and `importModel` takes it off again.
Pass `neverPrefix` as `true` to suppress the addition, but the resulting file
is not valid SBML.

Both `writeYAMLmodel` and `exportModel` take `sortIds`, which sorts a copy
before writing and leaves the caller's model untouched.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from cobra.io import write_sbml_model

from raven_toolbox.io import write_yaml_model

write_yaml_model(small, "smallYeast-copy.yml")
write_sbml_model(small, "smallYeast.xml")

roundtrip = read_sbml_model("smallYeast.xml")
print(len(roundtrip.reactions), len(roundtrip.metabolites), len(roundtrip.genes))
```

```text
53 52 61
```

`write_yaml_model` and `export_to_excel` take `sort_ids`, which sorts what is
written without touching the model. cobrapy's `write_sbml_model` has no such
argument, so a stable SBML diff needs the sort applied first, on a copy:
`write_sbml_model(sort_identifiers(small.copy()), path)`.
:::
::::

Both toolboxes write reactions in whatever order the model holds them, so
inserting one reaction near the front shifts every line after it. Sorting first
confines the diff of a one-reaction change to that reaction.

## 3.4 Spreadsheets

The Excel format holds the model as five sheets, covering reactions,
metabolites, compartments, genes and the model's own metadata, in a form that
can be edited without a toolbox.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
exportToExcelFormat(modelSmall, 'fileName', 'smallYeast.xlsx');
fprintf('%s\n', strjoin(sheetnames('smallYeast.xlsx'), ', '));
```

```text
RXNS, METS, COMPS, GENES, MODEL
```

`exportToExcelFormat` writes `.xlsx` and errors on any other extension, so a
bare directory path is rejected rather than interpreted. The
[RAVEN 3 migration guide](../raven3-migration.md#excel-io) covers scripts
that pass one. There is no matching importer: `curateModelFromTables` reads
a curated spreadsheet back by applying tabular edits to an existing model,
not by building one from scratch.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from raven_toolbox.io import export_to_excel

export_to_excel(small, "smallYeast.xlsx")

from openpyxl import load_workbook

print(load_workbook("smallYeast.xlsx").sheetnames)
```

```text
['RXNS', 'METS', 'COMPS', 'GENES', 'MODEL']
```

`export_to_excel` needs the `excel` extra (`pip install raven-toolbox[excel]`)
and writes the same five sheets, plus ENZYMES and ENZRXNS for an
enzyme-constrained model. Neither toolbox exports a whole model as a set of
tab-delimited files any more; the single reaction table that `exportForGit`
writes as its `txt` format is what remains, and pandas over the model's
collections covers the rest.
:::
::::

## 3.5 Export for a model repository

A Git-maintained model repository (yeast-GEM, Human-GEM, and the models built
from `standard-GEM`) keeps the same model in several formats under `model/`, so
that a release is usable without a toolbox and a diff is readable in a pull
request. Both toolboxes write that layout directly, one subdirectory per format
plus a `dependencies.txt` recording the versions the files were written with.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
exportForGit(modelSmall, 'prefix', 'smallYeast', 'path', 'repo', ...
    'formats', {'yml', 'xml'});

written = dir(fullfile('repo', 'model', '**', '*'));
written = written(~[written.isdir]);
fprintf('%s\n', strjoin(sort({written.name}), ', '));
```

```text
[Warning: The following fields have one or more entries that do not start with a letter or _ (conflicting with SBML specifications). Prefixes are added to all entries in those fields:]
Document written
dependencies.txt, smallYeast.xml, smallYeast.yml
```

`dir` reports names, so the subdirectories that contain the files are not
visible above: the layout written is `repo/model/yml/smallYeast.yml` and
`repo/model/xml/smallYeast.xml`. Set `subDirs` to `false` to put everything
in one folder instead. Identifiers are sorted before writing, with no option
to skip it, so successive releases diff cleanly. Left to itself
`exportForGit` writes all five formats,
`mat`, `txt`, `xlsx`, `xml` and `yml`; `formats` narrows that. `COBRAtext`
switches the `txt` table from metabolite names to metabolite ids, and
`mainBranchFlag` makes the export fail unless RAVEN itself is on its main
branch, which pins a release to a released toolbox version.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from pathlib import Path

from raven_toolbox.io import export_for_git

root = export_for_git(small, "repo", prefix="smallYeast", formats=("yml", "xml"))
print(sorted(p.relative_to(root).as_posix() for p in root.rglob("*") if p.is_file()))
```

```text
['dependencies.txt', 'xml/smallYeast.xml', 'yml/smallYeast.yml']
```

`export_for_git` returns the `model/` directory it wrote, and sorts a copy of
the model first, so the files are diff-friendly and the model you passed is
unchanged. Its default `formats` are `yml`, `xml`, `mat` and `xlsx`; ask for
`txt` explicitly if the repository expects one. `sub_dirs=False` flattens the
layout, and `varname` sets the variable name inside the `.mat` file for
repositories that pin one.
:::
::::

:::{warning} What can go wrong
- **The SBML writer refuses an identifier.** SBML ids must start with a
  letter or underscore. Both toolboxes add a prefix to a whole field when any
  id in it does not, which is why `importModel` and `read_sbml_model` strip
  prefixes on the way back.
- **Ids differ between two copies of the same release.** An id that contained
  a dot comes back encoded from SBML in Python. Compare on `model.name` or on
  annotations, or decode first.
- **Excel export fails with a missing module.** The Python side needs
  `openpyxl`; install `raven-toolbox[excel]`.
- **A YAML round trip loses a field neither format defines.** RAVEN YAML
  carries the RAVEN model fields; anything a plugin added outside them is not
  guaranteed to survive. Check with a diff, not by eye.
- **A hand-written SBML release diffs badly.** `exportForGit` and
  `export_for_git` sort identifiers for you, but a direct
  `write_sbml_model` does not, so a file written that way reorders whenever
  the model does.
