# 10. Context-specific models with tINIT and ftINIT

A genome-scale model describes what an organism *can* do. tINIT and ftINIT cut it
down to what a particular sample (a tissue, a cell line, a condition) appears to
be doing, from expression data plus a list of metabolic tasks the result must
still be able to perform.

This page walks through it on **Human-GEM**, with the RNA-seq data Human-GEM
ships, in both toolboxes.

!!! tip "Which one should I use?"
    **ftINIT.** It is the recommended method, and everything below uses it.

    Use tINIT (`getINITModel`) only to reproduce a model that was built
    with it. It remains supported and is not scheduled for removal, but it
    issues a `RAVEN:legacyMethod` notice to say it is not what new work should
    use. Silence it with `warning('off','RAVEN:legacyMethod')`.

    **tINIT is MATLAB-only.** RAVEN keeps it for the models already built with
    it; raven-toolbox, a new implementation with no such installed base, carries
    ftINIT and nothing else. A tINIT model has to be reproduced in MATLAB.

Despite the shared name, the two are **separate implementations that share no
algorithm code**. Reaction scoring and task gap-filling look forked in the
table below only because the two entry points call their shared functions with
different settings, not because two implementations exist:

| | tINIT | ftINIT |
|---|---|---|
| Entry point | `getINITModel` | `prepINITModel`, then `ftINIT` |
| Reaction scoring | `scoreModel` (fixed isozyme/complex scoring, `dataPrecedence` `'reaction'`) | `scoreModel`, `groupRxnScores` |
| Core MILP | `runINIT` | `ftINITInternalAlg`, scheduled by `getINITSteps` |
| Task gap-filling | `fitTasks` | `fitTasks` (`gapFillMode` `'preMerged'`), `ftINITFillGaps` |
| Gene pruning | inline in `getINITModel` | `removeLowScoreGenes` |

What they do share is RAVEN's general machinery rather than anything specific to
the method: `checkTasks` and `getEssentialRxns` decide which tasks are feasible
and which reactions they need, and beneath that sit `parseTaskList`,
`simplifyModel`, the solver layer and the model-manipulation and I/O functions.

`scoreModel` is one function for both: `getINITModel` calls it with a single
operator for both `and`/`or` in a grRule and `dataPrecedence` `'reaction'` (the
settings the original tINIT algorithm needs), converting an unmeasured gene's
score from `NaN` to `-Inf` afterward; `ftINIT` calls it with the general
defaults. Task gap-filling is likewise one `fitTasks` loop for both:
`getINITModel` uses the default `gapFillMode` (`'merge'`, backed by
`fillGaps`), `ftINIT` passes `'preMerged'` (backed by `ftINITFillGaps`, since
its reference model already contains the sample's own reactions and needs no
per-task merge). That MILP-formulation split (`fillGaps` merging per task vs.
`ftINITFillGaps` expecting a pre-merged model) is the one place gap-filling
genuinely differs, not `getINITModel` vs. `ftINIT` themselves.

!!! warning "The outputs on this page were produced by hand, not by the build"
    Every other page in this guide is re-executed on every commit. This one is
    not: preparing Human-GEM took **113 minutes** in MATLAB and **126 minutes**
    in Python, the MATLAB run producing a **159 MB** artefact, which no
    documentation build should attempt. The numbers below come
    from one real run (Human-GEM `main`, RAVEN `develop3`, Gurobi 13.0.2) and
    are quoted with their wall-clock so you can plan around them.

    For the same MATLAB workflow as the model's own documentation presents it,
    including comparison of the extracted models, see the
    [Human-GEM guide](https://sysbiochalmers.github.io/Human-GEM-guide/gem_extraction/),
    which is maintained alongside the model.

## Setup

Human-GEM ships everything needed except the toolbox:

<!-- run-examples: skip -->

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Human-GEM.git
```

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `model/Human-GEM.mat` (or `.xml`, `.yml`) | the template: 12 931 reactions, 2 848 genes |
| `model/reactions.tsv` | reaction annotations, including which reactions are spontaneous |
| `data/metabolicTasks/metabolicTasks_Essential.txt` | 57 tasks the extracted model must still pass |
| `data/datasets/Hart2015_RNAseq.txt` | TPM for five cell lines: DLD1, GBM, HCT116, HELA, RPE1 |

Both extractions are mixed-integer problems, so **GLPK will not do**: set Gurobi
up first ([6. Solvers and configuration](solvers.md)).

## 10.1 Prepare the template: once

The preparation finds the task-essential reactions, classifies every reaction
into omics-independent categories, merges linear stretches, and rescales the
stoichiometry so that a single big-M works across the model. It depends only on
the template and the task list, **not on your data**, so it is done once and
reused for every sample.

=== "MATLAB"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```matlab
    load('Human-GEM/model/Human-GEM.mat');          % the struct is called humanGEM
    tasks = parseTaskList('Human-GEM/data/metabolicTasks/metabolicTasks_Essential.txt');

    % spontaneous reactions are flagged in the model's own annotation table
    tsv   = readtable('Human-GEM/model/reactions.tsv', 'FileType', 'text', 'Delimiter', '\t');
    spont = tsv.rxns(tsv.spontaneous == 1);

    prepData = prepINITModel(humanGEM, tasks, 'spontRxnNames', spont, 'extComp', 'e');
    save('prepData.mat', 'prepData', '-v7.3');
    ```

    ```text title="Output, 113 minutes"
    prepData.mat: 159 MB
    ```

    Human-GEM also has a wrapper, `prepHumanModelForftINIT`, which reads those
    two files for you. It does **not** run against RAVEN `develop3`: its
    `importTsvFile` returns the `spontaneous` column as text, so the `== 1`
    inside it throws. Calling `prepINITModel` directly, as above, sidesteps that.

=== "Python"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```python
    import cobra
    from cobra.io import read_sbml_model

    from raven_toolbox.init import prep_init_model
    from raven_toolbox.tasks import parse_task_list

    cobra.Configuration().processes = 1     # see the note below

    model = read_sbml_model("Human-GEM/model/Human-GEM.xml")
    model.solver = "gurobi"
    tasks = parse_task_list("Human-GEM/data/metabolicTasks/metabolicTasks_Essential.txt")

    prep = prep_init_model(model, tasks, ext_comp="e")
    ```

    ```text title="Output, 126 minutes"
    load 115s
    prep_init_model 7552s
    ```

    Reading Human-GEM from SBML alone takes about **two minutes**, and the
    preparation itself **126 minutes**, the same order as MATLAB's 113, on the
    same machine and solver. Two things affect the run:

    - `prep_init_model` runs cobrapy's FVA, which spawns worker processes. Where
      that is not permitted (a locked-down Windows machine, some CI runners), it
      fails with `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`. Setting
      `processes = 1` trades the parallelism for a run that finishes.
    - `essential_cache_path` caches the slow task-essential discovery, so a
      second preparation of the same template skips it.

## 10.2 Bring in the expression data

RAVEN wants one struct: the genes, the sample names, and a genes × samples matrix
of levels. `threshold` is the level above which a gene counts as expressed; leave
it out and the mean across samples is used per gene instead.

=== "MATLAB"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```matlab
    tbl = readtable('Human-GEM/data/datasets/Hart2015_RNAseq.txt', ...
        'FileType', 'text', 'Delimiter', '\t');

    arrayData.genes     = tbl.gene;
    arrayData.tissues   = tbl.Properties.VariableNames(2:end)';
    arrayData.levels    = table2array(tbl(:, 2:end));
    arrayData.threshold = 1;
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    18687 genes x 5 samples
    ```

=== "Python"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    from raven_toolbox.init import gene_scores_from_expression, score_reactions_from_genes

    tpm = pd.read_csv("Human-GEM/data/datasets/Hart2015_RNAseq.txt", sep="\t", index_col="gene")
    print(f"{tpm.shape[0]} genes x {tpm.shape[1]} samples")

    gene_scores = gene_scores_from_expression(tpm["HCT116"].to_dict(), reference=1.0)
    rxn_scores = score_reactions_from_genes(model, gene_scores)
    ```

    The two steps are separate in Python: `gene_scores_from_expression` applies
    RAVEN's rule (**5·ln(level / reference)**, clamped to [−5, 10]) and
    `score_reactions_from_genes` pushes the result through the GPRs. Splitting
    them means any other source of gene scores (HPA via `hpa_gene_scores`,
    proteomics, a curated list) feeds the same second step.

    Seeing the clamp directly explains why two very different samples can
    produce nearly the same model:

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```python
    print(gene_scores_from_expression({"a": 12.0, "b": 0.5, "c": 3.0}, reference=3.0))
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    {'a': 6.93, 'b': -5.0, 'c': 0.0}
    ```

    `b` computes to −8.96 and comes back at the floor; a gene exactly at its
    reference scores zero, neither in nor out.

### Scores from the Human Protein Atlas

A transcript table is one source of gene scores. The Human Protein Atlas is
another, and both toolboxes read it directly.
[`hpa-sample.tsv`](../data/hpa-sample.tsv) is a ten-row excerpt in HPA's
proteomics format: the six columns the parsers expect, five human genes across
two tissues, with the levels chosen so each category appears. A real dump is
`normal_tissue.tsv` from
[proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download).

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    hpaData = parseHPA('hpa-sample.tsv');
    fprintf('%d genes, %d tissue/cell-type columns\n', ...
        numel(hpaData.genes), numel(hpaData.tissues));
    fprintf('levels: %s\n', strjoin(hpaData.levels, ', '));
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    5 genes, 3 tissue/cell-type columns
    levels: High, Low, Medium, Not detected
    ```

    `parseHPA` returns a struct rather than a table. `genes` and `geneNames`
    hold the Ensembl ids and the symbols, `tissues` and `celltypes` are parallel
    arrays with one entry per tissue and cell-type combination rather than per
    tissue, and `gene2Level` is a sparse genes-by-combination matrix whose values
    index into `levels`. Reading a level therefore takes two steps, the same
    indirection `model.metComps` uses in
    [2. Model structure and identifiers](model-structure.md).

    The `version` argument is accepted and ignored: the format is inferred from
    the column headers. `hpaData` is what `ftINIT` takes as its fourth positional
    argument, in place of the `transcrData` used above.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.omics import parse_hpa

    hpa = parse_hpa("hpa-sample.tsv")
    print(hpa.df.shape[0], "rows")
    print("tissues:", hpa.tissues())
    print("cell types in liver:", hpa.celltypes("liver"))
    print("levels:", sorted(hpa.df["level"].unique()))
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    10 rows
    tissues: ['kidney', 'liver']
    cell types in liver: ['bile duct cells', 'hepatocytes']
    levels: ['High', 'Low', 'Medium', 'Not detected']
    ```

    `parse_hpa` returns an `HPAData` wrapping a tidy pandas DataFrame on `.df`,
    one row per gene, tissue and cell type, with the columns renamed to
    `gene_id`, `gene_name`, `tissue`, `celltype`, `level` and `reliability`, so
    ordinary grouping and filtering apply before any of it becomes a score.
    `tissues()` and `celltypes()` save writing the obvious queries.

    MATLAB's parallel arrays plus a sparse index matrix answer "what is the level
    of gene i in combination j" directly; the DataFrame answers "show me every
    row for this tissue". Neither holds anything the other does not.

### Levels to numbers

HPA reports a category, not a quantity, so a level has to become a number before
the scoring above can use it.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.omics import HPA_LEVEL_SCORES, hpa_gene_scores

    print(HPA_LEVEL_SCORES)

    scores = hpa_gene_scores(hpa, tissue="liver")
    for gene, score in sorted(scores.items()):
        print(f"  {gene}  {score:+.1f}")
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    {'High': 20.0, 'Medium': 15.0, 'Low': 10.0, 'Not detected': -8.0, 'Strong': 20.0, 'Moderate': 15.0, 'Weak': 10.0, 'Negative': -8.0}
      ENSG00000067225  +20.0
      ENSG00000106633  +15.0
      ENSG00000111640  +20.0
      ENSG00000156515  +10.0
      ENSG00000159399  -8.0
    ```

    The mapping is exposed as `HPA_LEVEL_SCORES` and is replaced by passing
    `level_scores=`. Both vocabularies are covered: `High`/`Medium`/`Low`/`Not
    detected` for expression, and `Strong`/`Moderate`/`Weak`/`Negative` for
    antibody staining, scoring the same.

    On the MATLAB side there is no separate step: `scoreModel` takes `hpaData`
    and applies the mapping internally.

A negative score is a statement, not a missing value. `Not detected` scores
**-8**, which pushes a reaction towards exclusion; a gene absent from the tissue
is omitted from the result instead, and the reaction scorer falls back to its
`no_gene_score`. The two produce different models.

### One gene, several cell types

A tissue has several cell types, and a gene can be measured differently in each.
`PKM` in the excerpt is `High` in hepatocytes and `Low` in bile duct cells.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    best = hpa_gene_scores(hpa, tissue="liver", multiple_celltype="best")
    average = hpa_gene_scores(hpa, tissue="liver", multiple_celltype="average")
    print(f"PKM  best {best['ENSG00000067225']:+.1f}, "
          f"average {average['ENSG00000067225']:+.1f}")
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    PKM  best +20.0, average +15.0
    ```

    `"best"` takes the maximum and is the default, matching RAVEN. `"average"`
    takes the mean. The maximum states what the tissue is capable of, the mean
    what it does across the cells in it. Passing `celltype=` selects one and the
    question does not arise.

`parseHPArna` and `parse_hpa_rna` read the RNA-seq dump instead, whose header is
`Gene`, `Gene name`, `Tissue` followed by the TPM columns. Those are quantities
already, so `rna_gene_scores` applies the same logarithmic rule as 10.2 rather
than a level mapping. Both routes end at a gene-to-score mapping, which is what
`score_reactions_from_genes` walks the GPRs with.


## 10.3 Extract a model for one sample

=== "MATLAB"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```matlab
    contextModel = ftINIT(prepData, 'HCT116', [], [], ...
        'transcrData', arrayData, ...
        'INITSteps', getINITSteps([], '1+0'));
    ```

    ```text title="Output, 70 seconds"
    9595 rxns, 1761 genes
    ```

    Two argument traps, both of which fail without mentioning the argument you
    got wrong:

    - `hpaData` is the **fourth positional** argument. Skip it and the expression
      struct lands on `metabolomicsData`, reporting `Metabolomics contains the
      same metabolite multiple times`.
    - the step list is `'INITSteps'`, not `'steps'`. An unrecognised name is
      taken as a positional value, and you get that same misleading error.

=== "Python"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.init import ftinit

    context = ftinit(prep, rxn_scores, series="1+0", gene_scores=gene_scores)
    print(len(context.reactions), "reactions,", len(context.genes), "genes")
    ```

    `ftinit` takes the reaction scores directly rather than the expression
    struct, which is why the scoring is a separate step above. `gene_scores` is
    optional and prunes negative-scoring genes from the GPRs that survive;
    `fill_gaps=False` skips the task repair.

**`1+0` or `1+1`?** `1+0` leaves out most reactions that have no gene rule and
takes 30–60 s per sample; `1+1` adds a second optimisation over those reactions,
takes two to three times longer, and gives a smaller model. The run above is
`1+0`: **12 931 → 9 595 reactions and 2 848 → 1 761 genes, in 70 seconds.**

## 10.4 Check what came out

An extracted model is a hypothesis. The tasks it was built to satisfy are the
first thing to re-check, and the least expensive.

=== "MATLAB"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```matlab
    taskReport = checkTasks(contextModel, [], 'taskStructure', tasks);
    ```

=== "Python"

    <!-- run-examples: skip -->

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.tasks import check_tasks

    report = check_tasks(context, tasks)
    print(sum(1 for result in report if result.passed), "of", len(report), "tasks pass")
    ```

Then compare the result against the template and against the other samples:
[9. Quality control](quality-control.md) covers the structural checks, and the
Human-GEM guide's
[GEM comparison](https://sysbiochalmers.github.io/Human-GEM-guide/gem_comparison/)
covers comparing many extracted models at once.

!!! warning "What can go wrong"
    - **Identifiers that do not match.** Human-GEM speaks ENSEMBL, and so does
      `Hart2015_RNAseq.txt`, which is why no mapping step appears above. With
      symbols or systematic names you need one; score a handful of genes and
      check they are not all at the floor before spending two hours on the
      preparation.
    - **Re-preparing per sample.** The preparation depends only on the template
      and the tasks. Do it once, save it, and reuse it; separating preparation
      from extraction is what makes that possible.
    - **No MILP solver.** Both extractions are mixed-integer; GLPK cannot.
    - **A model that no longer does what you assumed.** Without a task list there
      is nothing to repair against, and the extraction is free to remove
      capabilities you never thought to check.
