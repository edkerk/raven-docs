# 6. Solvers and configuration

Every simulation on this site ends in a linear program, and something has to
solve it. This page is about which solver that is, how to change it, and how to
read what it gives back.

## Setup

`smallYeast.yml` from [`docs/data/`](../data/README.md), with glucose and oxygen
opened so there is something to solve.

In this model the uptake reactions are written as `=> metabolite` and shipped
shut at `[0 0]`, so uptake is a **positive** flux and opening one means raising
its *upper* bound. Reverse that and you get a model that solves, reports success,
and grows at exactly zero.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
model = readYAMLmodel('smallYeast.yml');
model = setParam(model, 'ub', {'glcIN', 'o2IN'}, [1 1000]);
```
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from raven_toolbox.io import read_yaml_model

model = read_yaml_model("smallYeast.yml")
model.reactions.get_by_id("glcIN").upper_bound = 1.0
model.reactions.get_by_id("o2IN").upper_bound = 1000.0
```
:::
::::

The sign convention here is the opposite of yeast-GEM's, where uptake is a
negative flux through an exchange reaction. Neither is more correct; a model
carries whichever its author chose, and the direction the equation is written in
decides which bound opens it. [5. Growth media and conditions](media.md) works
through the other convention.

## 6.1 Which solver is in use

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
fprintf('RAVEN solver preference: %s\n', getpref('RAVEN', 'solver'));
```

```text
RAVEN solver preference: ...
```

RAVEN keeps the choice in MATLAB's preferences, so it survives restarts, and
the answer is whatever *this* installation was last told, which is why the
output above is elided. The preference is global to the installation, not a
property of the model, so a script that changes it changes it for everything
that follows. `checkRaven` prints it along with a test solve.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from cobra import Configuration

print("default:", Configuration().solver.__name__)
print("this model:", model.solver.__class__.__module__)
```

```text
default: optlang.glpk_interface
this model: optlang.glpk_interface
```

cobrapy has two levels: `Configuration()` is the default applied to models
created from then on, and `model.solver` is the interface this model is
actually using. Because the choice travels with the model, two models in one
session can use different solvers.
:::
::::

## 6.2 Change it

Both toolboxes ship with **GLPK**, which is enough for every LP on this site.
Gurobi is required for the mixed-integer problems that gap-filling and
`getMinimalMedium` solve, and is faster on large models; it is free for
academic use.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
setRavenSolver('glpk');     % 'gurobi', or 'cobra' to hand over to the COBRA Toolbox
```

Those three are the accepted values. `'glpk'` uses the binaries RAVEN ships,
so it works with no further installation. `'gurobi'` needs Gurobi on the
MATLAB path. `'cobra'` translates the problem into COBRA Toolbox form and
uses whatever `changeCobraSolver` last selected, which requires the COBRA
Toolbox to be initialised first; `setRavenSolver` checks that and errors
rather than storing a preference that cannot work.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
model.solver = "glpk"       # or "gurobi", "cplex", "osqp", ...

from cobra import Configuration
Configuration().solver = "glpk"     # the default for models loaded later
```

Assigning to `model.solver` rebuilds this model's problem; assigning to
`Configuration().solver` changes the default for models created afterwards
and leaves existing ones alone. The available names are whichever optlang
interfaces are installed.
:::

## 6.3 What comes back

The two solution objects carry the same information under different names.

| MATLAB `solveLP` | cobrapy `Solution` | |
|---|---|---|
| `sol.f` | `solution.objective_value` | objective value, same sign in both |
| `sol.x` | `solution.fluxes` | fluxes: a vector in `model.rxns` order, or a Series by id |
| `sol.stat` | `solution.status` | how the solve ended |
| `sol.msg` | `solution.status` | what the solver said |
| `sol.sPrice`, `sol.rCost` | `solution.shadow_prices`, `solution.reduced_costs` | duals |

`sol.stat` takes four values: `1` solved to optimality, `0` feasible but not
proven optimal, `-1` infeasible, and `-2` solved but with the flux minimisation
of parsimonious FBA failing afterwards. Only `1` means the fluxes are the answer
to the question that was asked.

The duals are the exception to the correspondence: RAVEN reports `sPrice` and
`rCost` only when `solveLP` runs without flux minimisation, because the second
optimisation replaces the problem whose duals they describe.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
model = setParam(model, 'obj', 'biomassOUT', 1);
sol = solveLP(model);
fprintf('stat %d: %s\n', sol.stat, sol.msg);
fprintf('growth %.4f /h\n', sol.f);
```

```text
stat 1: Optimal solution found
growth 0.1222 /h
```

`solveLP` builds a COBRA-style problem struct and hands it to `optimizeProb`,
which is where the selected solver is actually called. Calling `optimizeProb`
directly is the way to solve a problem the toolbox built for you, such as the
MILPs inside gap-filling, and it takes a `params` struct forwarded to the
solver. Two fields of `params` are handled by RAVEN rather than passed on:
`verbose`, which shows MILP progress, and `maxRatio`, which splits
badly-scaled columns through auxiliary metabolites before solving and leaves
the feasible region unchanged.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
model.objective = "biomassOUT"
solution = model.optimize()
print(f"status {solution.status}")
print(f"growth {solution.objective_value:.4f} /h")
```

```text
status optimal
growth 0.1222 /h
```

`model.solver` is the optlang problem itself, so the underlying solver is
reachable for anything cobrapy does not expose: `model.solver.problem` is the
native object, and `model.solver.configuration` carries tolerances,
time limits and thread counts.
:::
::::

## 6.4 When the solve fails

An infeasible problem is the most common outcome of a bad edit, and the two
toolboxes report it differently: RAVEN sets `sol.stat` to `-1` and returns an
empty flux vector, while cobrapy raises nothing at all; `optimize` returns a
solution with status `infeasible`, and `slim_optimize` returns `nan`.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
broken = setParam(model, 'lb', 'biomassOUT', 1);   % demand growth with no glucose
broken = setParam(broken, 'eq', 'glcIN', 0);
sol = solveLP(broken);
fprintf('stat %d: %s\n', sol.stat, sol.msg);
```

```text
stat -1: The problem is infeasible
```

`sol.f` and `sol.x` are empty here, not zero, so arithmetic on them produces
an empty result rather than an error. That is how an unchecked infeasible
solve turns into a blank in a report.
:::
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
with model:
    model.reactions.get_by_id("biomassOUT").lower_bound = 1.0
    model.reactions.get_by_id("glcIN").bounds = (0, 0)
    print("status:", model.optimize().status)
    print("slim_optimize:", model.slim_optimize())
```

```text
status: infeasible
slim_optimize: nan
```

Check the status before using a number. `slim_optimize` skips building a full
solution, so it is the fast option inside a loop, but it returns `nan` instead
of a reason.
:::
::::

An infeasible model is over-constrained: the constraints as written have no
solution at all. That is different from a feasible model whose optimum is zero,
which is a statement about biology rather than about the constraints.

:::{warning} What can go wrong
- **A solver that is set but not installed.** `setRavenSolver('gurobi')`
  stores the preference whether or not Gurobi is there; the failure appears
  at the next solve. `checkRaven` tests it directly.
- **MILP with GLPK.** GLPK solves LPs only, in RAVEN. Anything mixed-integer
  (`getMinimalMedium`, some gap-filling) needs Gurobi.
- **Reading fluxes after a non-optimal solve.** `sol.stat` of `0` means a
  feasible point was found but not proven optimal, and `-2` means the
  parsimonious step failed after an optimal first solve. Both return numbers.
- **Tiny differences between solvers.** Alternative optima mean two solvers
  can return different flux distributions for the same objective value. Pin
  one solver for anything you intend to compare.
