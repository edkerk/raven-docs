# 7. Building a model from scratch

Add metabolites, a reaction, a gene association and the exchanges that let
material in and out — and end with a model that carries flux. This is how a
hand-built model starts, and how you test an idea before an automated
reconstruction is involved.

|---|---|---|
| `addMets` | `Metabolite` <span class="cobrapy-tag">cobrapy</span> | add metabolites |

The important part is the same in both: **write the reaction as an equation
string** and let the toolbox derive the stoichiometry, rather than filling in a
column of the stoichiometric matrix by hand.

## Setup

[`empty.xml`](../data/empty.xml) is RAVEN's starter model: four metabolites —
sucrose, glucose, fructose and water — and one reaction, invertase, which splits
sucrose into glucose and fructose. Everything is in one compartment, `e`.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    model = importModel('empty.xml');
    fprintf('%d reactions, %d metabolites\n', numel(model.rxns), numel(model.mets));
    eqn = constructEquations(model);
    fprintf('%s\n', eqn{1});
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    The model contains 0 errors and 1 warnings.

    [Warning: The following fields have prefixes removed from all entries. If this is undesired, run importModel with removePrefix as false. Example: importModel('filename.xml',[],false); model.rxns (R_ prefix) model.mets (M_ prefix)]
    1 reactions, 4 metabolites
    sucrose[e] + H2O[e] => glucose[e] + fructose[e]
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from cobra.io import read_sbml_model

    model = read_sbml_model("empty.xml")
    print(len(model.reactions), "reactions,", len(model.metabolites), "metabolites")
    for reaction in model.reactions:
        print(f"  {reaction.id}: {reaction.reaction}")
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    1 reactions, 4 metabolites
      r1: m1 + m4 --> m2 + m3
    ```

## 7.1 Add metabolites

We are going to add hexokinase, so the model needs ATP, ADP and
glucose-6-phosphate first.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    metsToAdd.mets = {'m5', 'm6', 'm7'};
    metsToAdd.metNames = {'ATP', 'ADP', 'glucose-6-phosphate'};
    metsToAdd.compartments = 'e';
    metsToAdd.metFormulas = {'C10H12N5O13P3', 'C10H12N5O10P2', 'C6H11O9P'};
    model = addMets(model, metsToAdd);
    fprintf('%d metabolites\n', numel(model.mets));
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    7 metabolites
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from cobra import Metabolite

    model.add_metabolites([
        Metabolite("m5", name="ATP", formula="C10H12N5O13P3", compartment="e"),
        Metabolite("m6", name="ADP", formula="C10H12N5O10P2", compartment="e"),
        Metabolite("m7", name="glucose-6-phosphate", formula="C6H11O9P", compartment="e"),
    ])
    print(len(model.metabolites), "metabolites")
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    7 metabolites
    ```

    Give every metabolite a **formula** and a **compartment** as you add it. Both
    are what [9. Quality control](quality-control.md) checks against, and adding
    them later means revisiting every reaction written in between.

## 7.2 Add a reaction

The equation string is the same in both toolboxes: `<=>` for a reversible
reaction, `=>` for an irreversible one.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    rxnsToAdd.rxns = {'HEX1'};
    rxnsToAdd.rxnNames = {'hexokinase'};
    rxnsToAdd.equations = {'m2 + m5 => m7 + m6'};
    rxnsToAdd.grRules = {'YFR053C'};
    model = addRxns(model, rxnsToAdd, 'eqnType', 1, 'allowNewGenes', true);

    idx = getIndexes(model, 'HEX1', 'rxns');
    eqn = constructEquations(model, {'HEX1'});
    fprintf('%s\n', eqn{1});
    fprintf('bounds: [%g %g], genes: %s\n', model.lb(idx), model.ub(idx), ...
        model.grRules{idx});
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    New genes added to the model:
    YFR053C
    glucose[e] + ATP[e] => ADP[e] + glucose-6-phosphate[e]
    bounds: [0 Inf], genes: YFR053C
    ```

    `eqnType` says how the equation is written: `1` matches metabolites by
    **id**, `2` by name, `3` by `name[comp]`. `allowNewGenes` is needed because
    `YFR053C` is not in the model yet — without it `addRxns` refuses, and you
    would call `addGenesRaven` first. cobrapy creates the gene silently, which is
    convenient until a typo becomes a gene.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from raven_toolbox.manipulation import add_reactions_from_equations

    add_reactions_from_equations(model, [
        {
            "id": "HEX1",
            "name": "hexokinase",
            "equation": "m2 + m5 => m7 + m6",
            "gene_reaction_rule": "YFR053C",
        },
    ])

    hex1 = model.reactions.get_by_id("HEX1")
    print(hex1.reaction)
    print("bounds:", hex1.bounds, "genes:", hex1.gene_reaction_rule)
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    m2 + m5 --> m6 + m7
    bounds: (0.0, 1000.0) genes: YFR053C
    ```

    The arrow sets the bounds, so an irreversible reaction needs no `bounds` key.
    A gene named in the rule is created if the model does not have it — there is
    no separate "add the gene" step, which is what `addGenesRaven` is for in
    MATLAB.

## 7.3 Add exchanges

A network with no boundary cannot carry flux: under the steady-state assumption
every internal metabolite must be produced and consumed at the same rate, so a
metabolite that appears in only one reaction blocks it. Exchange reactions are
that boundary.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    model = addExchangeRxns(model, 'both', 'mets', model.mets);
    fprintf('%d reactions\n', numel(model.rxns));
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    NOTE: The exchange reactions are assigned to the first compartment
    9 reactions
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    for metabolite in list(model.metabolites):
        model.add_boundary(metabolite, type="exchange")

    print(len(model.reactions), "reactions")
    print(sorted(rxn.id for rxn in model.exchanges))
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    9 reactions
    ['EX_m1', 'EX_m2', 'EX_m3', 'EX_m4', 'EX_m5', 'EX_m6', 'EX_m7']
    ```

    `add_boundary` works out that `e` is the external compartment. It refuses
    when nothing looks external, which is the usual reason it fails on a small
    hand-built model — give a compartment a recognisable name, or build the
    exchange as an ordinary reaction with a single metabolite.

## 7.4 Does it carry flux?

The first question to ask of anything you just built.

=== "MATLAB"

    ```matlab
    model = setParam(model, 'obj', 'HEX1', 1);
    sol = solveLP(model);
    fprintf('HEX1 flux: %.2f\n', sol.x(getIndexes(model, 'HEX1', 'rxns')));
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    HEX1 flux: 1000.00
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    model.objective = "HEX1"
    solution = model.optimize()
    print(f"HEX1 flux: {solution.fluxes['HEX1']:.2f}")
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    HEX1 flux: 1000.00
    ```

!!! warning "What can go wrong"
    - **A typo silently creates a metabolite.** Both toolboxes add metabolites
      they do not recognise, so `m7` and `M7` become two different things and the
      pathway quietly breaks. Pass `allow_new_mets=False` in Python, or `false`
      as the last argument of `addRxns` in MATLAB, once the metabolites are all
      defined.
    - **No exchange reactions.** The model then gives zero flux everywhere, with
      no error to explain why.
    - **A model with no external compartment.** `add_boundary` cannot guess one,
      and RAVEN's `addExchangeRxns` will happily add exchanges for internal
      metabolites — which is rarely what you meant.
