"""Execute the Python examples in the guide pages and check their output.

The guide pages promise that the reader can paste a snippet and get the printed
result shown underneath it. Nothing enforces that: ``check_names.py`` only
verifies that the *names* in a page exist, so a page can name real functions,
call them with arguments that no longer work, and show output that was correct
two releases ago.

This script closes that gap, for **both** language tabs. For every page it

* collects the ```python (or ```matlab) blocks in order -- including the ones
  nested inside ``=== "Python"`` / ``=== "MATLAB"`` content tabs,
* runs a page's blocks in one namespace (one Python namespace, or one MATLAB
  workspace), in a scratch directory seeded with a copy of ``docs/data/``, so the
  snippets can use the short relative paths the reader sees,
* captures what the block prints -- plus the repr of a trailing expression, the
  way a notebook or the REPL would -- and compares it with the ``title="Output"``
  block that follows,
* reports every mismatch as a unified diff and exits non-zero.

MATLAB needs a MATLAB runtime on the PATH (or ``RAVEN_DOCS_MATLAB`` pointing at
one); RAVEN itself comes from the submodule, and the bundled GLPK is used so no
solver licence is involved. When MATLAB is missing, its half is skipped with a
notice rather than failing -- unless it was asked for explicitly.

Usage::

    python scripts/run_examples.py                     # both languages, docs/guide
    python scripts/run_examples.py --language python   # one language
    python scripts/run_examples.py docs/guide/fba.md
    python scripts/run_examples.py --update            # rewrite output blocks in place
    python scripts/run_examples.py --list              # show what would run

Page-level control, written as HTML comments in the markdown:

``<!-- run-examples: skip-file -->``
    anywhere in the page -- the page is not executed at all (use for pages whose
    examples need BLAST, a KEGG download, or a commercial solver).
``<!-- run-examples: skip -->``
    immediately before a ```python block -- that one block is neither executed
    nor checked, but the ones after it still run.
``<!-- run-examples: needs-gurobi -->``
    the block needs a MILP solver: it runs where Gurobi is available (``--gurobi``
    or ``RAVEN_DOCS_GUROBI=1``, which CI sets when a licence is configured) and is
    skipped everywhere else.

``<!-- run-examples: tabs-differ -->``
    anywhere in the page -- the cross-tab check below is not applied to it,
    because the two tabs genuinely print different things.

An expected-output block consisting of a single ``...`` matches anything, and
``...`` inside a block matches any run of characters -- the same convention as
doctest's ELLIPSIS. Use it for timings, paths and long tables.

When both languages run, the tabs of each section are compared: a value printed
under the same label with the opposite sign in the other tab is reported. That is
the one thing the per-block check cannot see, since a block that runs cleanly and
prints a wrong number still matches the wrong number written beneath it.
